Prometheus Bled by kate of gaia 
Last night | died a thousand deaths, each by a thousand cuts 
And though | want to leave this path, continue on | must. 
How much more can my soul endure, this walk that steals my breath? 


Where all around me pick away this slow Promethean death? 


This place of hearts, so quickly drains, reserves, this gilded cage 
Entombed within the solace fair, cries out with neutral rage. 
That once I'm fallen, on broken knees, do the carrion gather high 


Where crows that cackle in the fray, in silence, | will cry. 


Forgive them gently, with Mothers' love, dig deep, yet deeper still 
Where those that fed from this weary child, do feed upon my will 
Where dare | stood, in truths profound, the blind eyes made to see 


As mortal flesh rots on their limbs, these walking dead and me. 


Can not they see beyond this vale, beyond their surly bounds? 
These fools that conflict searches out, still chains them to the ground. 
“I'm free!” they yell from towers high but know themselves not yet, 


They only see the flesh they're not , while caught in illusions’ net. 


So toil | must and stand | will to bleed another day 
Where somehow through this misty plain | can help them find their way 
To middle earth where ebb meets flow, the balance of the tides 


To climb Olympus' craggy face where Prometheus resides. 


Since for his gift of fires truth, the ascensions of the mind, 
Wrought from his flesh, his liver torn, where morrows’ day does find, 
His quest ordeal renews again sacrificial daily bread 


Is where | share these self-same truths in the way Prometheus bled.
