| fully accept this paperwork on the following non-assumption, non- 
presumption terms: 
Inasmuch as all languages/creations are based on sounds and shown via sigils, 
letters, numbers and words, no assumption and/or presumption can be made 
solely upon the spellings contained within a single language such as "English" / 
Angle-man only where all sounds have various definitions in various languages. 
In short, my definition of your "whirreds" are pure jibberish as | define them 
where | fully accept this "paperwork" as per my definitions using all available 
sounds/languages/intent ions as per my positive betterment. See the following 
examples for your issuing this jibberish: | only speak Phoenician, the root of 
Roman Civil Law and the basis of all man made laws/jibberish in defiance of 
natural law/sound; 
Ontario: on, to be on top of, tar, a road surface material and io/e-owe/no-owe 
with e as a prefix meaning "no" etc.....2??? 

Superior: Sous, French for under or a tribe of Indians, Sioux, Sue, a girls calling, 
peer or pier, Someone who is deemed equal or a place to tie up a boat and 
"ior", Eyore, a stuffed animal from Winnie the Pooh etc.....2??? 

Court: Core, the center of something, coup, coo, a sound a pidgeon makes, 
couer, meaning heart in French, curt, where the "o" is silent as it can be in 
many whirreds, sort, where a "c" can be sounded as an "s" or f, or ph, k, ch 
etc......"T'", which is the comparable in the Phoenician sigils that is a circle with 
an "X" inside it akin to a sniper's rifle scope etc... 

No assumption or presumption can be made using this undefined intent that 
has been sent and will not be accepted and fully accepted at the same time 
based only on my interpretations of the sounds created as per my 
understanding of the sounds and noone else's. Please send back with every 
word defined, with references, glossary of definitions using whatever 
dictionaries/Ares used, accessed, understood where | use all definitions/de (of) 
Phoenicians as per my free will, thank you.
