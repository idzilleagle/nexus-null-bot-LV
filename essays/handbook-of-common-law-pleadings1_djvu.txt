PREFACE 


Almost half a century has elapsed since the publication of the third, and final, edition of Shipman’s standard text 
on Common Law Pleading. The late Dean Alison Reppy, with whom I was associated in teaching tIx~ subject of 
Common Law Pleading, and who devoted much of his life to study in the field, commenced this work in an effort to 
meet the need for a new comprehensive work on the subject, but an untimely death cut his efforts short. I was at the 
time in a position to assume this undertaking, and have worked over the many succeeding years upon the preparation 
of this work. The responsibility for that appears in these pages is therefore mine. 


It is my hope that this work will be of assistance to members of the bench, bar, and students of the law, in 
their professional and scholarly pursuits, I will briefly describe some of the principal features of this work, which are 
directed towards this end. 


First: Substantial new materials have been introduced into this work, in addition to the retention of the basic 
materials included in the Shipman text. This results in the presentation of a wider area of coverage in terms of topics 
dealt with than is generally found in previous works on Common Law Pleading. A reference to the detailed table of 
contents will indicate the topics covered with some particularity. 


Second: In discussions of many of the topics, more has been included in the way of historical background and 
development than generally appears in previous comprehensive works on Common Law Pleading. 


Third: Many of the topics have been more extensively treated than is generally the case in comprehensive 
works on Common Law Pleading. It has always been my view that significant emphasis should be placed upon 
materials dealing with the forms of action. Certainly most members of the bench, bar, and students of the law, carry 
with them the memory of Professor F. W. Maitland’s incisive and perceptive observation that, “The forms of action 
we have buried, but they still rule us from their graves.” This fact has remained too clearly in focus to be blurred 
from vision by the Codes, and it is considered at some length in the pages of this work. 


The apportionment of additional space and emphasis is not limited to the forms of action, but is found in the 
treatment of many of the other topics throughout this work. This is done with a recognition of the validity of Justice 
Oliver Wendell Hohnes’ statement that, “whenever we trace a leading doctrine of substantive law far enough back, 
we are very likely to find some forgotten circumstance of procedure at its source.” And to this we may add that 
whenever we deal with a modern procedural rule, we are likely to gain a better understanding of it, and a utility for 
its application, by virtue of a knowledge of Common Law Pleading. 


Fourth: The status under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court of most of the principal procedural 


Page 4 of 735 


devices, including all of the forms of action, is considered in the discussion of each of these topics. The vi- 


xvii 
PREFACE 


tality and usefulness of a knowledge of Common Law Pleading may be readily appreciated when we find that its 
concepts are still present, and underlie the various aspects of Modern Pleading and Practice. 


Fifth: Extensive bibliographies of treatises and articles appear at substantially all of the points where the 
principal topics are discussed. Citations of treatises generally include edition and place and date of publication, so as 
to make the sources more readily available. Such extensive bibliographies have not been included in the earlier 
comprehensive works on Common Law Pleading, and it is hoped that this may have the effect of making research 
considerably less taxing, and substantially more productive. 


Sixth: For the English cases, in addition to citations in the original reports, parallel citations in the English 
Reports, a reprint series, are also generally included. Previous compreheusive works on Common Law Pleadings do 
not contain these citations, as indeed the English &eports were not yet published when most of them were written. 
Since law libraries frequently do not contain the original reports, but do contain the English Reports, research may 
be pursued with these citations without the use of conversion tables and digests, which might otherwise be 
necessary. This, too, should make research easier and more productive for members of the bench, bar, and students 
of the law. 


The decisions, both English and American, have been extensively cited in order to convey an understanding 
of Common Law Pleading in its early, middle, and later stages, its development, and its effect in Modern Pleading 
and Practice. 


I can, of course, do no more than to record my indebtedness to the late Dean Alison Reppy, who commenced 
this work with such enthusiasm and dedication during his lifetime. I am also indebted to Shipman’s work, and to the 
works of the many other outstanding authors who have contributed so much in the field of Common Law Pleading. 
Any attempt to recite all of their names at this point would result in the inevitable risk of omission, and I will 
therefore ask the reader to take notice of their respective contributions as he makes use of this work. I also wish to 
express my appreciation to my colleague, Professor John It. Dugan, for generously giving of his time to discuss with 
me certain of the topics included in this work. And for the secretarial services so faithfully performed by Mrs. Amy 
Smith in working upon the manuscript, I express my appreciation. 


I have attempted to set out some of the characteristics of this work in the succinct form required of prefatory 
remarks, and sincerely hope that this work will serve the purposes for which it is intended.

5- In referring to the Improvement In the Science of Pleading, Sir Edward Coke declared: ‘In the Reign of Edward I (1327—i277) 


Pleadings grew to Perfection, both without lameness and curiosity; for then the Judges and Professors of Law were excellently learned, and 
then Knowledge of the Law 


flourished; the Serleants of the Law, &c. drew their own pleadings, and therefore [it was] truly said by Justice Thirning, in 
the Reign of Henry IV (1399— 1413) that in the time of Edward III the Law was in a higher degree than it had been any time 
before; for before that time the Manner of Pleading w~s but feeble, In comparison of that It was afterward In the Reign 
of the same KIng.” 2 Coke, Lit. tieton, 304b, LIb. 3, Cap. 0, ~ 534 (1st Am. from the 16th European ed. by Francis Hargrave 
and Charles Butler, PhIladelphia, 1812). 
uer and Common Pleas—and for two hundred years it was the exclusive procedural device leading to the Trial of 
Legal Issues in the United StatesIt was, however, subject to many defects, 
due largely to the fact that the entire English Procedural System had grown up in a patchwork fashion,’ while the 
constantly expanding Substantive Law was outgrowing the Forms of Action which gave it birth. In the latter part of 
the Eighteenth and early part of the Nineteenth Centuries, under the impetus of Bentharn’s searing criticism of the 
existing System of Law in England, with its Courts, its Special Pleading, and its general atmosphere of Delay and 
Administrative Inefficiency, these restrictive influences be-caine clear to the people, a demand for Reform sprang up 
and the movement for the improvement of procedure slowly got under way, 
The impact of this development, strangely enough, first bore fruit in America in the State of Louisiana, with the 
framing of Livingston’s Code of Practice ~ and the Penal Code in 1824, which latter was never adopted.~ This was 
followed in England by the adoption of the Rilary Rules in 1834,6 and 


3. “The Remedial Part of the Law resembled a mass of patchwork, made up at intervals and by plecemeal, withoutany preconceived 
plan or system, for the purpose of meeting the exigencies of the times by temporary expedientt” Walker’s Introduction to 
American Law, Pt, VI, Lecture XXXV, 569 (11th Cd., Boston, 1905).

5. Livingston’s Penal Code, which was a product of Intensive preparation, and was published in 1824, was never enacted Into Lair as such by the 
Legislature of Louisiana. 

Edward LIvingston was born in 1764 and died In 1836, or about six years after Field began his ProfessIonal Career. A 
native of New York, and a brother of Chancellor Robert It. Livingston, his Penal Code of Louisiana, which was published in 
1824, attracted great attention in England and on the Continent. David Dudley Field Centenary Essays, 19 (EdIted by Reppy, New 
York, 1949).

in the United States by the New York Code of Procedure in 1848.~ Thereafter, in relatively quick succession, the 
English Parliament enacted the Common-Law Procedure Acts of 1852,8 1854,° and 1860,10 and the Supreme 
Court of Judicature Acts of 187311 and 1875,12 now for the most part replaced by the Supreme Court of 
Judicature (Consolidation) Act of 1925.13 And in 1938 the Supreme Court of the United States made effective 


the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.’ In conseGeneral Issue, were promulgated pursuant to the Law Amendment 
Act, 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 42, ~ 1 (1833).

1548, N. Y.Laws 1848, c. 379, to become effective on July 1 of the same year. Written in the form of a Code Containing 391 Sections, it 


became known at once as the Code of Procedure or as the Field Code. This title was far too broad in scope as the Act related only to a 
small portion of the Adjective Law, and expressly retained the Old Common Law or Statutory Rule where not expressly abolished by the 
Code.” Reppy, The Field Codification Concept, in the David Dudley Field Centenary Essays, 17, 33— 34 (Edited by Reppy, New York,

quence thereof, both at home and abroad, the System of Pleading as developed at Common Law, has been Modified 

by Judicial Decision, Changed by Statute, or by Rule of Court, and in some Jurisdictions ostensibly swept away in 

its entirety—so the Reformers thought—but subsequent events have cast grave doubts on this conclusion, as the sol- 
emn and stubborn fact is that Common-Law Pleading still survives as the basis of our Modern Remedial Law.’~ 


Select any individual and you will find that he is what he is today because of what his father and mother were 
yesterday; he cannot escape his ancestry, but must make his way through life with the physical, mental, moral and 
spiritual assets with which he was naturally endowed by the union of his parents. It is true that within certain limits 
he may seem to change with his environment,

In this connection it should be recalled that progress in the Reform of Criminal Procedure has followed up and to some extent paralleled 
the Reform of the Civil Procedure which has been under way since 1848. In 1930 the American Law Institute issued its Code of 
Criminal Procedure, which has subsequently substantially influenced State Criminal Procedural Developments In the Several States, In 1941, 
pursuant to the rule-making authority granted to the Supreme Court by Congress, the Advlsory Committee on Rules of Criminal Procedure 
was appointed by the Court, which published two Prellmiaary Drafts, with motes, and its Final Report to the Court in July. 1944. The rules 
suggested therein were adopted, with certain modifications, by the Court on December 26, 1944, to become effective on March 21, 1946. The 
Court also gave directions that the Rules be reported to Congress In accordance with the terms of the Enabling Act, 323 U.S. 821, 65 S.Ct. 
CLXXIV (1944).

acquire a better training, and contribute more to the community than did his forbears, but any advance or improvement 
he may make must be done within the limits of his ancestral background. And so it is with institutions such as the 


Law which, after all, are merely the product of joint individual effort. The Law is what It is today because of what the 


Page 19 of 735 


Law was yesterday; it cannot escape its ancestry, and it, too, must progress against the background of its history. 
Like the individual, so with the Common-Law System of Procedure, which we all proudiy claim as a priceless part 


of our Anglo-Saxon heritage, We may change, we may add to or take away those Parts of the System which have 
outgrown their usefulness, just as the Modern Common-Law Actions superseded the Old Real Actions 16 when they 
became archaic, but it is no more possible, in any realistic sense, to abolish the System in its entirety, with all its 
implications for both the past and the future, than it is for an individual to destroy his ancestry, or for mankind to 
abolish history or civilization. 


e Infinite damage has been done to the cause Of legitimate Legal Reform, to the cause of 


16, The old Real Actions fell under one of the heads of Blackstone’s famous classification of Actions as Real, Personal and Mixed. The Real 
Actions were by far the most important during the early developmental period of the Common Law. Included therein were Writs of Right 
Proper and Writs in the Nature of Writs of Rigb~ such Writs, among others, as the Writ of Right de rationabili parte, the Writ of Advowson, 
the Writ of Dower, the Writ of Dower wide nihul Rabet, and the Writ of quare impedit. These actions were feudal In character and were 
concerned with disputes over land. Because of the technlcalities required Ia their Control and the length of tUne Involved in carrying their 
process through, these actions, along wlth those which fell under the other two heads, were gradually superseded by what are now known as 
the Eleven Modern Common-Law Personal Actions, as a result of evolutionary steps In the development of the Common Law. What had, 


In effect, long before occurred as d matter of practice, was officially recognized by the Real Property Limitation Act of 1883, 3 & 4 Wni. 

IV, e. 27, § 36, which swept aside the Real and Mixed Actions, with certain exceptions, effective December 31, 1834. 
Legal Education, at the expense of litigants, students of law, and the public welfare generally, by proclaiming the 
concept that all that has gone before in our procedural ancestry should be regarded as obsolete and worthless,’ and is not 
to be considered in terms of Modem Pleading and Practice, aid in terms of Modern Legal Education -Those who take 
this limited view have clearly confused the real merits of the Common-Law System with those portions of the 
System which were needlessly technical, thus overlooking the salient fact that it had developed many sound and 
enduring principles of legal procedure. They have also overlooked the fact that there is greater similarity in the 
essential principles underlying Pleading at Common Law, in Equity, under Modern Codes and Practice Acts, and 
even under the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure now in effect in the Federal Courts, than is generally realized.’ 


17. Sir Montague Crackeuthorpe, O.C., in an address to the American Bar Association, in reference to the utility of the study of Common-Law 
Pleading stated:”Jn the hands of those who understood it, the System of Common-Law Pleading was infallible iii attaining the purpose for 
which it existed. If all who brought Causes to Trial had possessed a proper acquaintance with this Branch of Law and a reasonable mental 
alertness, it would never have beer, hinted that Pleading was a means of turning the decision of a question from ‘the very Right of the 
Matter’ to immaterial points. But pleaders of inferlor and slovenly mental disposition suffered themselves to be misled, deliberately It is to be 
feared, by theft’ more acute brethren; arid the pop— ular mind came to consider the whole system a mere series of traps and pitfalls 
for the unwary,— an Impediment to Justice that must be abolished. In truth, even these evils might well have been remedied by 
allowing free liberty of amendment, and reducing to a moderate sum the costs payable on the grant of such privilege. Those concerned 
in reform movements, however, often lose sight of their real object In a feverish anxiety to ‘cut deep’ and at once; and this explains why the 


system for bringing a cause to trial In convenient and exact form was discarded.” Note, Common Law Pleading, 10 Harv.L.Rev. 238, 239 
(1896).

“The Problems and Functions and Principles of Pleading are essentially the same in all systems, whether at Common Law, under

Thus, in Minnesota, Ia the ease of Solomon v, Vinson, Si MInn, 205, 17 NW. 340 (1883), a Code Complaint which alleged, among other 
things, that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff on an Account Past Due, for Goods Sold and Delivered, was held to 
contain an the Allegations necessary to constitute a good Indebtedness count in an Action of Debt at Common Law, the Court 
remarking thet “under that System of Pleading It was just as necessary to allege the Facts as it is under the Code.” 

in Crump V. MIms, 04 NC. 707, 771 (1370), Rodman, 3., declared: “We take occasion here to suggest to pleaders that the Rules of the

Common Law as to Pleading, which are only the rules of logic, have not been abolished by The Code. Pleas should not state the 
Evidence, but the Facts, which are the Conclusions from the Evidence, according to their legal effect; and complaints should 
especially avoid wandering Into matter which if traversed would not lend to a decisive Issue. It is the Object of all Pleading to 
arrive at some Single, Simple and Material Issue.”

have the Fundamental Conceptions common to all Systems of Procedure as to the manner of making Allegations 
which reveal the contentions of the rival Parties, been changed. As Lord Mansfield so well said: 

“The Substantial Rules of Pleading are founded in strong sense, and in the soundest and closest logic; and so 
appear, when well understood and explained; though, by being misunderstood and misapplied, they are made use of as 
instruments of chicane.” 1- fi- a result of such misapplication and chicanery by men who resorted to the 


technicalities of Special Pleading to serve their own selfish ends, as a result of the portrayal by its €Nemies of the 
System as a mere game of skill, in which the helpless litigant became a pawn in a wilderness of arbitrary 
technicality and confusion; in which it was pictured as the master and not the servant of the courts, or as an end in 
itself, instead of an instrument for the fair and equitable adjustments of substantive human rights, the System of 
Pleading and Procedure as developed at Common Law, was gradually brought into popular disrepute by the efforts 
of well-meaning Reformers, who emphasized its admitted Defects, but failed to point out to the people of England 
and the United States the matchless precision of the Old System as a vehicle for reducing human controversies 
into distinct Issues of Fact or of Law, which could be satisfactorily adjusted, thus achieving the principal end 
of all government, to wit, the preservation of Law and Order. Entirely too much time and effort have been

“Such was the humor of the age that this captiousness was not dIscountenanced by the Beach. ,.-The calamity has been that after other

21. Among the eulogies by Judges, Lawyers and Writers, may be listed the following:

Littleton, during the Reign of Edward IV [1461—1483], In referring to the Art of Common-Law Pleading, declared: “And know, 
my son, that it is one of the most Honourable, Laudable, and Profitable Tbings in our Law, to have the science of well pleading 
In Actions Real and Personal; and therefore I counsel thee especially to imploy thy courage and care to learn It.” 2 Coke, Littleton 
(Institutes of the Laws of England] Lib. 3, Cap. 9, § 534 (1st Am. from the 10th European ed., Philadelphia, 1812). 


Professor Samuel Tyler stated: “It (the Common-Law System of Pleading] must be admitted to be the greatest of all judicial 
inventions.” First Report of the Maryland Commissioners on Rules of Practice in the Courts 80, 91 (1855). 


“This [the Common-Law] System, matured by the wisdom of ages, founded on Principles of Truth and Sound Reason, has been 
ruthlessly abolished in many of our States, who have rashly substituted in Its place the suggestions of sciolists, who invent new 
Codes and Systems of Pleading to order. But this attempt to abolish all species, and establish a single genus, is found to be beyond the 
power of legislative omnipotence. They cannot compel the human mind not to distinguish between things that differ. The distinction 
between the different Forms of Actions for different wrongs, requiring different remedies, lies In the nature of things; it IS abso- 
lutely Inseparable from the Correct Administration of Justice In Common-Law Courts.” Grier, 3., in 

erations, in both England and America, should be pointed up and emphasized as well as its long-term significance 


as the fountain-source of our Modem Substantive and Remedial Rights, if not our very liberties,” and 


finally, its value as an influence which continues and must inevitably continue to mould future Anglo- 
Saxon Conceptions of Law and 


McFaul v. Ramsey, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 523, 525, 15 LEd. 1010, 1011 (1857). 

According to Professor Keigwin, Cases in Code Pleading, 16 (Rochester, N. Y. 1926), the Code has been of doubtful value In simplifying 
procedure: “One who will read the Reports of New York or of any other Code State will observe that before the Reform 
comparatively few Cases turned upon points of pleading, and that most of such eases involved questions of Substantive Law which 
were presented in technical guise by reasons of their Development upon the Record; it will also be observed that the adoption of the 
Code was at once followed by a large Increase of litigation concerning procedural matters, which kind of litigation shows no present signs of 
abatement. Indeed, the current digests disclose an immensely greater number of cases decid ing pure Matters of Pleading in the Code 
States than eases of that kind coming from Common Law Jurisdictions. One reason, of course, is that the Common Law 
system is so thoroughly settle’ ] that few novel questions can arise.” 


This problem under the Codes is also discussed in Sunderland, Cases on Procedure Annotated, Code Pleading, Preface viii (Chicago, 
1913). 


“The love of innovation induced the State of New York some years ago, to abrogate Common-Law Pleading, and introduce a Code of 
Procedure for the regulation of litigation in her courts; and notwithstanding the lamentable confusion and uncertainty, and the 
greatly increased expense which has thereby been brought into the Administration of Justice in that State, other States have 
followed in her track of barbaric empiricism. Mr. Justice Grier has, from the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States, 
rebuked the folly of abolishing Common-Law Pleading, and substituting the Common-Sense Practice, as it may be called, in 
its stead.’” Stephen, A. Treatise on the Principles of Pleading, Preface, vii (3d Am. ed. by Tyler, Washington, IJ. C. 1892).

Justice in a free society, if we are to preserve our ideal of Government by Law as opposed to Government by Men.” 


What, then, is the place of Common-Law Pleading in the Law and what is its real significance to Modern 
Procedure? 


THE PLACE OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING IN THE LAW 


1. Anglo-American Law is divided into Pub-lie Law and Private Law. Private Law is separated into Substantive 
Law and Adjective Law, with Common-Law Pleading constituting the first procedural topic thereunder, 


ANGLO-AMERICAN law has been separated into two main divisions—Public Law— which has to do with 
the regulation of relations between independent states and between a State and its citizens, and—Private Law— which 
regulates the relations between the citizens of the state. Private law, in turn, is divided into two branches, to wit, 
Substantive Law, which defines rights and liabilities, and Adjective or Procedural Law, which furnishes the ways 


Page 22 of 735 


and means of enforcing these rights and liabilities. And Adjective Law, in its broadest aspects and prior to 1848, 
included (1) Common-Law Pleading; (2) Equity Pleading; (3) Evidence, and (4) Trial Practice. The position of 
Common-Law Pleading in the Law will, therefore, appear clearly from the chart on the next page. 


As a result of the impact of the New York Code of Procedure in 1848,24 our Modern Syszs Apparently the 
earliest use In America of the 
phrase, Government by Law as opposed to Government by Men, is found in Part I, Art. 30, of the Massachusetts 
Constitution of 1780. 
24. KY.Laws 1848, c. aia 
tern of Code Pleading,” which is a combination of the better elements of the Common Law and Equity 


Systems of Pleading, came into existence. 


The influence of this development under the Codes finally led, in 1938, to the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
for the regulation of Practice in the Federal Courts. 
Following the example of the nation some of the states subsequently abandoned their Codes in favor of a 
System of Procedural Regulation by Rule of Court. This treatise, however, is concerned primarily with the 
fundamental principles of Civil Pleading and Practice as developed at Common Law. And Civil Procedure is “the 
mode of proceeding by which a legal right is enforced, as distinguished from the law which gives or defines the right.” 26 


25. “Code Pleading is the term applied to the Reformed System of Pleading initiated by the New York Code of 1848 and now in force in 
-, American jurisdictions. It Is this latter system which concerns us in this book. But since it developed from the former systems 
and in many respects continues various details and parts of them, it is necessary to consider the antecedents of Code pleading in 
the other systems.” Clark, Handbook of the Law of Code Pleading, c. 1, History, Systems, and Functions of Pleading, 4 (2d ed,, 
St. Paul 1947).

For a definition of Procedure, compare the following: 
“Procedure may be defined as a Series of Symbolic Actions, generally accompanied by words, nnd, in developed societies, by the 
Exhibition of Written Documents, by means of which Rights or Liberties guaranteed by a society are reasserted by its individual members. 
Reassertlon Is the Essence of Procedure; for in the sense in which we shall use the term—the sense of regaining before a competent 
court a status that has been lost or questioned—it assumes an already violattd right.” Greenidge, The Legal Procedure of 
Cicero’s Time, Introduction, 1 (Oxford 1901).

the Historical Development of the 
Law; 


(ID It is essential as an aid in understanding the early English and American decisions in which Rulings on the

(III) It Is an essential ingredient of the process by which the Law Student acquires the technique of analyzing 
Causes of Action; 


(IV) It is essential to a full and comprehensive understanding of Modern Pleading and Practice. 


To the beginning student or prospective lawyer, an understanding of the fundamental principles of Common-Law 
Pleading and PrOcedure is highly essential. While the greater portion of our Modern Law School Curriculurn is devoted 
to a consideration of Substanfive Law, the student should constantly -bear in mind that a litigant’s Substantive 
Rights ordinarily cannot be effectively sustained ex 


27. “The importance of a study of Common-Law Pleading rests, first, on the relationship between the Modern Substantive and Ancient Remedial 
Law in the scheme of Forms of Action; second, the relationship between Modern Remedial and Ancient Remedial Law; and, 


Page 24 of 735 


third, the fact that the Older Cases are expressed in Terms of Pleading, so that they cannot be studied understandingly without it. The 
Statutes which seek to abrogate or simplify Common-Law Pleading use its terms. In order to understand the progress of the law, the well-edu- 
cated Lawyer must live through its evolution. Further, in Modern Codes the foundation ideas of pleading have not changed.” Shipnian, 
Elendbook of Common-Law heading, 4, 5 (3d ed. by Ballantine, St. Paul 1023). 

See, also, Vanderbilt, Cases and Materials on Modern Procedure and Judicial Administration, c. I, Intro-

cept by one adequately trained in the Art and Science of Procedure, who appreciates the technical steps and 
maneuvers necessary to present properly his client’s case in Court, and how to conduct it to a successful conclu- 
sion. A mere Mechanic of the Law may get in and out of the court, but often to the detriment of the client’s interest, 
and in a manner destructive of the standards of the legal profession. If, however, he desires to become an Artisan of the 
Law, to fully appreciate the significance of the Reformed Procedure and the procedural tools used for the 
protection of his client’s interest, he must understand the fabric of the Common Law out of which they have been 
constructed. In order to do this he must be conversant with the evolutionary steps which led up to our Modern 
System of Procedure. In short, unless a lawyer is sufficiently expert in handling the procedural devices available 
under the Law, any knowledge which he acquires concerning the Substantive Law goes for naught. It thus appears 
that a mastery of Adjective Law is a prerequisite to a mastery of the Law as a whole if a person hopes to become a 
successful lawyer. For as Justice Story so truly said: “No man ever mastered it, (Special Pleading) who was not by that 
very means made a profound lawyer.” ~ It is necessary, therefore, that every individual who desires to become a 
serious Student of the Law should have a full appreciation of the importance of Common-Law Pleading. 


In the first place the study of Common-Law Pleading is important because through 


28. This statement by Justice Story was made ia “An Address Delivered Before the Members of the Suffoll~ Bar, at their Anniversary, on the 
Fourth of September, 1821, at Boston,” anti is reported in 1 Am.Jur, 1, 28 (18291. 

Special pleading, In popular language, refers to the adroit and plausible advocacy of a client’s ease in court. But, from the viewpoint of the 
Common Law, it refers to piending by Specifle Aliegations as opposed to General Allegations. tuepburn, The Development of Code 
Pleading, c. II, OtS, 66 (Cincinnatti, 1897); Clark, Handbook of the Law of Code Pleading, c. I, 13, n. 24 (2d ed., St. Paul 1947)].

its study- the student acquires a working appreciation of the Historical Development of the Law. He comes to realize 
the relationship between Procedural and Substantive Law, that Right and Remedy are bound together,” that 
Substantive Rights are expressed in terms of Remedial Rights and Forms of Action. In short, it is essential to realize 
that the Forms of Action are, in fact, the categories of legal liability, and that most of our Modern Substantive 
Contract, Tort and Property Law, had its origin in and developed out of Procedure, It was in this very connection 
that Sir Henry Maine observed that the rules of Substantive Law had the appearance of being “secreted in the in- 
terstices of Procedure.” 3° What Maine was saying was that the study of the Forms of Action is one of the richest 
sources of information for the student of legal development and theory, that there can be no true understanding of 
the Law except as against its Historical Background and that this history can only be fully and intelligently 
interpreted in the light of the Origin and Growth of Procedure.” 


29. Mait]and clearly had this in mind when, in referring to the dependence of Eight upon Remedy, as illustrated by the Common Law 
Forms of Action, he declared: “The Forms of Action we have buried, but they still rule us from their graves.” The Forms of 
Action at Common Law, Lecture 1, 2 (Cambridge, 1945). 

30. Maine, Early Law and Custom, c. XI, 359 (New York, 1880). 


But compare the statement of Street, who declared: 
“To the modern mind no line of cleavage is more marked than between Substantive and Adjective law. It was not always so. The 
very term ‘Adjective Law’ was first used by Bentham. In early stages of legal growth the two elements are inseparable.” 3 
Foundations of Legal Liability, e. I, I (Northport, 1000). 

31. Sir Montague Craekenthorp, Q,C., in an address to the American Bar Association, in reference to the ntility of the study of 


Common-Law Pleading, stated: “And, so long as Written Pleadings remain, the best masters of the art will be they who can inform 
the apparent licence of the new system with that spirit of exaethess and self-restraint which 


In the second place a knowledge of Common-Law Procedure is essential as an aid in understanding the early 
English and Amen-can decisions in which Rulings on the Law are only -comprehensible to the Modem Student in 
the light of a working knowledge of Pleading at Common Law. The Issues in these early cases, framed at a period of 


Page 25 of 735 


time when it was not yet certain whether the Pleadings should be English, French, or Lat- in, and while they were still 
in their Develop2~ mental Stage,” were necessarily formulated on the basis of the Older System. In consequence, 
the opinions rendered in these cases are sometimes in language and phraseology understandable only by one versed 
in the Common-Law System of Procedure. Thus, the phrase “the lessor of the plaintiff” is tinderstandable only in 
the light of the Fiction of Ejectment; the doctrine of quid pro quo has meaning only to one who has studied the early 
cases involving Debt; and an “executed consideration” is meaningful only against the historical development of 
Assuinpsit out of the Tort action of Trespass on the Case Super So Assumpsit. Moreover, one called upon to 
consider a decision in the Year Books ~ might be struck by the inclusion of much material or discussion which had 
no apparent bearing upon the final result.” But such inclusion would be clear to one acquainted with the History of 
Pleading, particularly that Stage of it in which the Pleadings were settled in the heat of battle, in the presence Of 
one’s adversary, arid by a process of Oral Altercation in which the Litigants, the Enilows from a knowledge of the old.”

rolling Clerks, the Lawyers and the Judges played leading roles.” 


In the third plaCe, a knowledge of Procedural Law is an essential ingredient of the process by which the 
beginning Law Student acquires the technique of analyzing Causes of Action.*° Pint, it has value as an exercise in 
legal logic, and it serves “to fix the attention, give a habit of reasoning closely, quicken the apprehension, and 
invigorate the understanding.” ~ These qualities constitute the foundation of all legal investigation. Second, the 
shadings between the Common-Law Forms of Action afford the student excellent practice in distinguishing one 
decision from another. Third, no educational device is comparable to a course on Common-Law Pleading for the 
purpose of teaching the beginner how to brief a case, reduce the controversy to a single, clear-cut, well-defined 
Issue of Fact or of Law, determine the holding of the Court and formulate the Rule and Principle of the decision. In 
short, it is an excellent device for extracting, like the roots of an equation, the true points in dispute; it is a 
time4ested scheme of matchless precision for separating the Issues of Fact from the Issues of Law, for the purpose 
of referring the case to the Court or the Jury. Finally, it gives the Student a valuable insight into the problem of what 
constitutes a Cause of Action, which is a necessary technique under any System of Procedure. 


In the fourth place, a knowledge of Common-Law Pleading is essential to a full and comprehensive 
understanding of Modern

Ch. 1 


Pleading and Practice. In making a study of Pleading at Common Law the student is not dealing with Rules which 
are obsolete and without intimate relation to the Existing Law. The fundamental principles of Common-Law 
Procedure still prevail; only its technical and archaic characteristics have been abolished by Modem Codes, Practice 
Acts and Rules of Court. This is true because Code Pleading springs from a Common-Law Ancestry; because 
Codification at best is only partial in scope, hence the principles of Common-Law Pleading necessarily remain as the 
great Residuary Law from which the gaps in the Code System of Procedure have been and will continue to be 
filled,'® and against the background of which its every provision must be construed and understood. Thus, to give 
but one example, the Code states that “the Complaint must be stated in plain and concise language,” which calls for 


Page 26 of 735 


explanation or interpretation. Does it actually mean what it says or does it mean something else? After full 
consideration the Courts have found that at Common Law the Declaration, in order to state a good Cause of 
Action, was required to state Ultimate Facts, and not Evidentiary Facts and not Conclusions of Law, and that the 
Rule under the Statutory Provision in question is the same as at Common Law.” The provision therefore, has no 
meaning except as construed against its Common-Law Background. 


With a statement in mind of the reasons why a knowledge of Common-Law Pleading is important, it may next be 
helpful to consider the Functions of Pleading. 


38. “Alt those preexisting Rules [of Pleading, at Common Law or in Equity~ which are not expressly abrogated, and which can 
properly be made applicable under the ne~v system [the Code) remain in force.” Selden, J., in Rochester City Bank & Lester v.

THE FUNCTIONS OF PLEADING AT COMMON LAW’? 


3. The Functions of Pleading at Common Law ate six in number and may be listed as follows: 

(D The first or Primary Function of Pleading is to reduce the controversy between the Parties to a single, 
clear-cut, well-defined Issue of Fact or of Law; 

(ii) To reduce Questions of Fact to clear-cut Issues by eliminating immaterial and incidental matter, 
thus narrowing the ease to one or more specific propositions on which the controversy turns, thus 
operating as an aid to the Court in admitting or rejecting offers of evidence; 

(III) To notify the Parties and the Court of the respective Claims, Defenses, 
and Counter-Demands of the adversaries; 
(IV) To serve as an index to the respective Counsel as to the Points to be Proved at the Trial and as a Guide to 
the Court in Apportioning the Burden of Proof and Rebuttal as between the plaintiff and defendant; 
(V) To serve as a Formal Basis for the 
Judgment; 
(VI) To preserve a Record of the Controversy Litigated and to create a foundation for the Plea of Res 
Judicata, thus preventing a relitigation of the same controversy between the same Parties at a later 
date. 


THE principal reason why many ordinary controversies are utterly fruitless and inconclusive is that prior to the 


discussion there is NO ascertainment by the contending parties of the Issues at stake. If every discussion were 
preceded by a clear-cut settlement of 


40. “The Function of Pleadings then is to ascertain with precision the matters on which the parties differ and the points on which 
they agree; and thus to arrive at certain clear Issues on which both parties desire a judicial decision,” Odgers, Principles of 
Pleading and Practice, e. 6, 67 (14th ed., by Lewis Sturge, London 1952). 


the questions in dispute, it would not prove difficult to settle the actual differences between the disputants, and 
in many instances it would develop that there was in reality no difference of opinion."' Pleading, which is a 
Statement in a Logical, Legal Form of the Facts which constitute the Plaintiff's Cause of Action or the 
Defendant’s Ground of Defense,” is designed to prevent the presentation of such fruitless and immaterial contro- 
versies in Courts of Law. The Functions of Pleading, therefor, have been developed with this end in mind. 


The first or Primary Function of Pleading is to reduce the controversy between the Parties to a single, clear- 


cut, well-defined Issue ~ of Fact or of Law, or, stated in another way, to Separate Issues of Law from Issues of

decided as far as possible prior to the Trial of the Facts. This was made necessary by the dual character of the 
Common-Law Tribunal, that is, of the Court, which generally decides Questions of Law, and the Jury, which gen- 
erally determines Issues of Fact. By this process the Matters on which the Parties differ and the Points on which they 
agree, are ascertained with precision, and thus the Issues over which the Parties are contending are presented for 
judicial determination. The Pleadings are not, as frequently assumed in popular estimation, an advocate’s address to 
the Judge or Jury. On the contrary they are the Formal Statements, drawn up by the Counsel of the Respective 
Parties, of the plaintiff's Cause of Action or the Defendant’s Defenses, From the clash of assertions are disclosed the 
points in controversy, the propositions affirmed on one side and denied on the other, on which the decision of the 
case will turn. Thus, the Primary Function of Pleading, that is, of defining the Issues over which the Parties are 
contending, is achieved. “The points admitted by either side are thus extracted and distinguished from those in 
controversy; other matters, though disputed, may prove to be immaterial; and thus the litigation is narrowed down 
to two or three matters which are the real questions in dispute,” ~ on which the case may be judicially tried in the 
most expeditious manner. 


It is a great benefit to the Parties to know exactly what are the Facts remaining in dispute, and what Facts the 
plaintiff must Prove to sustain his Cause of Action or the defendant to establish his Defense. The question involved 
may be reduced to an Issue of Law, in which case it may be decided by the Judge upon Argument, or it may 
involve a Question of Fact, in which case, it may involve a lengthy Trial by Jury. By separation of Questions of 


Law from Questions of Fact, the Parties may be saved great trouble and ex's. Odgers, Principles of Pleading and 
Practice In 

Civil Actions in the High Court of Justice, e. 6, 66 

(14th ed., London 1952). 


pense in procuring evidence of Facts which the opponent does not dispute, and the State may escape the burden 
and cost of supervising the litigation of Immaterial Issues. 


The secotul Objective of Pleading is to reduce Questions of Fact to clear-cut Issues, by eliminating immaterial 
and incidental matters, and narrowing the case to one or more definite propositions on which the controversy really 
turns, thus serving as a guide to the Court in Rulings upon Offers of Evidence. As the Pleadings define and limit the 
Proof, so also do they have a bearing upon the Admission or Rejection of Evidence. Thus, if A brings Trespass for 
Assault and Battery, B Pleads Self-Defense, and A denies the striking in Self-Defense, the issue presented is: Did B 
strike in Self-Defense? Now, if B offers Evidence that he did not strike A, the Court is in a position to Rule out the 
Offer of Proof, as such offer has no logical tendency to support the defendant’s Plea that he struck in Self-Defense. 


The third Objective of Pleading is to notify the Parties themselves and the Tribunal which is to decide between 
them of the itspective Claims, Defenses, arid Cross-Demands of the adversaries. Some Advocates of Reform, 
irritated by the mischiefs incident to the abuse of technical Rules of Pleading, have suggested that the Parties to an 
Action should come into court without any Notice as to the Complaint or Answer. It is evident, however, that such a 


Page 28 of 735 


System would lead to fraud, oppression and expense in a civilized state where commercial transactions are both 
numerous and complicated. If, then, Notice is essential, does a mere General Notice 40 of the Plaintiff s Cause of Ac 


4-. Issue Pleading, as opposed to Notice Pleading, prevailed at Common Law, as the chief Objective of Pleading was to reduce the 
controversy to an issue Of fact or or law. Fact Pleading came in with Code Pleading, which emphasizes the need for an accurate 
statement of the facts, while in recent yenrs there has developed what Is known as Notice Plead-

tion and the Defendant’s Ground of Defense, serve every purpose? Thus, suppose the Plaintiff s Declaration reads 

as follows: 

“The Plaintiff Alleges that the defendant did not pay a bill of exchange for $50.00.” to whiëh the defendant 


interposes the following 
Plea: 


“The defendant states that he is not liable on the bill.” 


From the Plaintiff’s Statement it could not be determined on the Pleadings whether he had a sufficient Cause of 
Action or not, and from the Defendant’s Plea, it coUld not be detennined whether the defendant denied the 
acceptance of the bill, or the other legal requisites essential to liability; or, assuming their existence, whether the 
defendant intended to set up New Matter such as fraud by Way of Answer; nor whether the Issue was One of Law 
or of Fact. In such a situation every case would have to be considered by a Jury in order to ascertain that there was 
no Fact in dispute. It thus appears that the evils of giving no Notice would exist nevertheless, expense would be 
incurred as the Parties would have to come to Trial prepared to Offer Proof on anything relating to the case, 
although only one matter was in reality in dispute. It seems evident, therefore, that 


ing, or merely giving notice to an opponent of the claim which is being asserted.

“the defendant is entitled to know what it is that the Plaintiff Alleges against him; the plaintiff, in his turn, is 

entitled to know what Defense will be raised in Answer.” ~ In support of this view is the statement of Thomas, 3., 

in the Illinois case of Cook v. Scott,” who declared: “The province of the Declaration is to exhibit, upon the 

Records, the grounds of the Plaintiff's Cause of Action, as well for the purpose of Notifying the Defendant of the 

precise character of those Grounds, as of regulating his own Proofs.” 


The fourth Function of Pleading is to serve as an index to the respective Counsel as to the points to be proved at 
the Trial in support of the contentions of their respective clients and in Apportioning the Burden of Proof and

extent of its adaptation of its Rules to the accomplishment of its Main Functions, that is, Fair Notice to the Parties 
and the accurate, practical and systematic presentation of the precise Questions of Law and Fact involvéd to the 
Tribunal which is to decide them. The various and possible Functions of Pleading may, therefore, be enumerated as 
follows: 


(1) To reduce the controversy between the Parties to a single, clear-cut well-defined Issue of Fact or of Law, and 
to separate Issues of Law from Issues of Fact, so that the Issues of Law may be determined as far as possible in 
advance of the Trial of the Facts; 


(2) To reduce Questions of Fact to clear-cut Issues by eliminating immaterial and incidental matters, and 
narrowing the case to one or more specific propositions on which the controversy really turns, thus operating as an 
aid to the Court in Admitting or Rejecting Offers of Evidence; 


(3) To notify the Parties themselves and the Deciding Tribunal of the respective Claims, Defenses and Counter- 
Demands of the Adversaries; 


(4) To serve as an index to the respective Counsel as to the Points to be Proved at the Trial and as a Guide to the 
Court in Apportioning the Burden of Proof and Rebuttal as between the plaintiff and defendant; 


(5) To serve as a Formal Basis for the Judgment; 


(6) To preserve a Record of the Controversy Litigated and to create a foundation for a Plea of Res Judicata, thus 
preventing a relitigation of the same controversy between the same parties at a later date. 


It thus becomes clear that historically, the principal purpose of the Rules of Pleading has been to compel each 
person to state the essential elements of his Cairn or Defense in order to arrive at an Issue. It has not always been 
true that Common-Law Pleading has accomplished the objective of reducing all cas 
es to definite Issues, this end being defeated on occasion by resort to technical procedural devices which had 
outgrown their days of usefulness.” But in both Common-Law and Code Pleading, the Issue-Raising Function far 
overshadows the Notice-Giving One, and is the source of the Principal Rules of Pleading. It is so under the Modern 
English Pleading. The case must be analyzed and reduced to Issues at the Trial, if not before, and it is inexpedient to 
postpone this essential preliminary to the day of Trial.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW OUT OF PROCEDURE 


4. The Beginning Student, if authorized to create an entirely New System of Law, would normally first define 
Rights and Liabilities and thereafter set up a System of Courts to enforce those Rights and Liabilities, whereas, as a mat- 
ter of historical knowledge, the Law grew up in exactly the opposite way; the great Body of our Modern Contract, 
Property and Tort Substantive Law having had its Origin in and Developed out of Procedure. 


UNDER Anglo-American law, the Substantive Law Defines rights and liabilities and the Procedural 
Law furnishes the ways 
and means of enforcing those rights and liabilities. But in what order did this development take place? Were rights 
and liabilities first defined and thereafter Courts established to enforce those rights and liabilities, or were Courts 
first set up and thereafter rights and liabilities defined? This question, if asked of a Beginning Student of the Law, 
will invariably be answered by a statement that rights and liabilities would first be defined, with the Courts to 
enforce them to be established thereafter.”

18 

BASIS OF MODERN REMEDIAL LAW 
Ch. 1 

In fact the Law grew up in exactly the opposite way, Courts being organized to handle a series of specific cases, 
the decisions of which gradually developed theories of rights and liabilities. In short, our rights and liabilities as 
defined by Substantive Law, had their origin in and developed out of Procedural Law. If this be true, how did it 
come about? Let us assume that A and B are shipwrecked and land on the proverbial uninhabited, deserted island. A, 
quickly recovering from the shock, shakes the water off, works his way up to a nearby knoll, where the ground is 
level and the view good, and says: 
“I like this place; I think I shall take possession,” Who owns that knoll? A owns it by reason of having first 
acquired possession, by reason of his strong right arm. As a result he may also be said to have acquired a moral but 
not a legal right to retain possession. Some time later, B pulls himself together, and discovers A on the knoll. An-ty- 
ing there, he surveys the prospect with satisfaction equal to that of A, and then, after pondering over the situation, 
declares: “1 like this knoll too; I think I shall take it.” “Oh, no you won’t,” exclaims A; “This knoll belongs to 
me.” “Oh, yes I will,” retorts B. “Oh, no you won’t,” bristles A; whereupon B, abandoning further argument, strikes 
A over the head with a club, and takes possession. Now, who owns the knoll? B. By what right? Not by a moral 
right, as A preceded him in possession in point of time; not by a legal right, because in the absence of a Court in 
which a remedy couid be sought, no such right yet existed. In reality B now owns the knoll by right of the strong 
arm; by right of might, that being at the moment the only Law in effect on the island. 


Without going into the evolutionary developments involved, let us say that time moves on, and later we find that 
other members have joined the society of A and B—men, women, and children, After this develop- 
ment, C) hits D over the head with a club; the blow glances off D’s head and strikes E, the child of a third 
party, Immediately there is great excitement in the community, The people crowd together, and someone is heard to 
say: “As long as A and B were the only inhabitants on this island, this business of their hitting one another over the 
head was their own affair; but now that there are others here, we must do something to control such actions.” But 
“What can we do” exclaimed the others! At this point someone suggested that the group shouid select a leader, hail 
the individuals before that leader, who would then hear both sides of the controversy and render a decision. 
Accordingly, the group chose its fastest runner, its wisest counselor, its best medicine man, its most esteemed 
religious adviser, or its greatest military leader, escorted him to the edge of the forest, and set him up on a stump to 
decide the controversy, Thus, was the Court or Tribunal created; thus, did the group take its first step in the 
Development of the Law; thus, did it prepare the way for transforming moral into legal rights. Then the group took 
C, D, and E before the newly created tribunal, In turn D and E were required to tell their story, and C was permitted 


Page 32 of 735 


to present his side, Before any decision was rendered the most that could be said in favor of D and F was that in the 
view of the group, their moral right not to be interfered with had been violated; as yet they had no legal rights as 
they were still without a remedy. After hearing both sides of the controversy, let us assume that the Court, presided 
over by the chosen leader, who has now become a Judge, fines C twenty hides, ten hides to go to the injured Parties, 
ten hides to go to the Community. At the moment of decision, Z) and F for the first time had acquired a legal right 
not to be struck, the moral right having been changed into a legal right through the acquisition of a legal remedy. 
Let us now as- 
Sec. 5 


sume further that after two or three similar episodes of this kind, in which the B’s and C’s were fined for having 
struck someone, the wiser members of the group, while wending their way home from the Court, began to reason 
somewhat as follows: If, when B strikes A over the head with a club, he is hailed before a Court and punished, it 
must be because A had a right not to be struck; if A has such a right, then B must be under a duty not to violate it; if 
B does violate A’s right not to be struck and his own duty not to strike, B commits a wrong for which he may be 
held liable, Thus, the concepts of right and duty,M of wrong and liability, are merely different sides of the same 
shield. If the rights violated involved a breach of duty to the community or state, the accused was said to be guilty of 
a criminal wrong whereas if the rights violated were concerned with breaches of duties as between individuals of 
the group or society, the accused were said to be guilty of a civil wrong. But at this stage of the discussion, the im- 
portant point to be observed in the foregoing account is that these primitive legal concepts of right, duty, wrong 
and liability, had their Origin in and Developed out of Procedure, that is, out of the process by which a myriad of 
single instances, of specific factual situations, were presented to and decided by a Court; that the Substantive Law 
right of A, D, and E not to be struck, came into existence only upon the pronouncement of Judgement by the 
Tribunal. 


This process not only produced a body of Substantive Contract, Property and Tort Law, but it also exercised, as 
we shall see, a profound effect upon the Form of our Judicial Organization, which in turn developed the five great 
Systems of Administrative, Admiralty, Common, Equity and Probate Law.

RELATION OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING TO OTHER SYSTEMS 


5. The Nature and Function of Pleading at Common Law may be better understood when viewed in its relationship to the 
Other Systems of Procedure which developed prior to, contemporaneous with, or even subsequent to it, 
including Equity and Code Pleading, as well as Pleading under the New Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 


IN order to give a better perspective of the Nature and Function of Common-Law Pleading as a factor in Anglo- 
Saxon Law, it may be well to consider its relation to the other Systems of Procedure which developed prior to, 
contemporaneous with, or even subsequent to it. These include Equity and Code Pleading, as well as Pleading under 
the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the relationship of which to Common-Law Pleading will now be 
considered. 


Relation to Equity Pleading 

EQUITY Pleading was the System of Pleading which was developed by the Courts of Equity in England, through 
the King’s exercise of a portion of his Judicial Prerogative in cases involving matters of conscience. The King’s 
authority was in the beginning handled through his Chancellor who was a Churchman trained in the Canon or 
Ecclesiastical Law, which had its roots in the Roman Law, hence it is not surprising to find that Both Systems 
failed to provide a Jury for the Trial of Facts. As a result of this characteristic, certain differences between the 
Common Law and Equity Systems of Procedure developed. 


In the first place, at Law, the Pleadings at Common Law were required to reduce the controversy to a single, 
clear-cut, well-defined Issue of Fact or of Law, whereas in Equity, there could be as many Issues of Law or of 


Page 33 of 735 


Fact as the Pleaders desired. This was due to the dual character of the Common-Law Court, which consisted of 
the Judge, who normally decided Questions of Law, and 
RELATION OF PLEADING TO OTHER SYSTEMS

BASIS OF MODERN REMEDIAL LAW 
Ch. 1 


the Jury, which decided Questions of Fact, as opposed to the Equity Court, consisting of the Chancellor only, who 
was a trained Lawyer, capable of handling Complicated Issues of Both Law and Fact. 


Secondly, and largely as a result of the first difference between the Two Systems, at Law, a plaintiff, in order to 
state a cause of action was required to state Ultimate Facts, and not Evidentiary Facts or Conclusions of Law, 
whereas, in Equity, he might plead Ultimate Facts, Evidentiary Facts, and even Conclusions of Law, as the 
Chancellor could unravel the Issues in spite of the resulting confusion. 


Thirdly, at Common Law only those Parties who had an interest in the right being litigated could be joined as 
plaintiffs and only those Parties who were subject to a joint liability could be joined as defendants, whereas, in 
Equity, the procedure for the joinder of parties plaintiff and defendant was much more flexible. 


Fourthly, at Common Law, a Party was frequently entitled to Trial by Jury as a matter of right, and if the Jury 
returned a Verdict in favor of such Party, its finding on the Facts was binding on the Court, whereas, in Equity, a 
Party was entitled to Trial by Jury only in the discretion of the Chancellor, and if, perchance, the Jury found in favor 
of a Party on the Facts, such finding was not binding on the Court, was only advisory in its effect, the Chancellor 
being free to disregard it in his discretion. 


Fifthly, at Common Law, a Judgment had to be rendered in favor of or against all the defendants; it could not be 
split, so as to apportion the liability among the defendants; whereas, in Equity the Decree could be split up and given 
against one or all of the defendants, thus allowing for a much more flexible apportionment of liability, without the 
necessity of further action. 


Sixthly, at Common Law, a Judgment merely determined the matter of right be- 
tween the Parties; it did not order the defendant to do anything, and if the defendant was not goaded into action by 
the mere moral suasion of the Judgment, the plaintiff was compelled to sue out an Execution on the Judgment, 
whereas, in Equity, the Decree not only determined the matter of right between the Parties, but it actually ordered 
the defendant to do something in recognition of that established right on peril of being punished for contempt for 
failure so to do. 


Seventhly, at Common Law, only Questions of Law were ordinarily open to Appellate Review; if the Error of 
Law was Apparent on the Face of the Record, it was Reviewable by Writ of Error; if it was Not Apparent on the 
Face of the Record, but was one which occurred at the Trial, prior to the Statute of Westminster II (1285) ~ the only 
Method of Review was after Verdict and before Judgment, by a Motion for a New Trial, but, after the Statute, such 
Errors could be reached by a Bifi of Exceptions, whereas, in Equity, both Questions of Law and Questions of Fact 
were Reviewable on Equitable Appeal. 


With these distinctions between Common Law and Equity Procedure in mind, it becomes readily apparent that 
when the Court of Equity undertook to settle matters of conscience in dispute between private Parties, influenced by 
the Civil Law background of the Chancellor, it naturally adopted the Civil Law Mode of Procedure, avoiding the 
Technical Rules of Pleading as they existed at Common Law. In theory, however, in Equity, as at Common Law, 
the forensic Altercations between the Parties might be carried to an unlimited extent, thus permitting the plaintiff 
and defendant through Alternate Allegations to frame Issues of Law or of Fact upon which the Court could base a 
Decree. In framing his statement of a cause of action in what was called a “Bill in Equity” as op

posed to a “Declaration at Law’, the plaintiff followed no set Form of Action, as at Common Law, but proceeded 
upon the board equities involved in the controversy, and stated the Facts at large, mingling both Questions of Féct 
and of Law, there being no need to separate them on the Record as at Law, since they were both to be decided by 
the Chancellor, who was trained in the art of sifting from the complicated statements the determinative Issues; 
whereas, at Law, Issues of Fact were to be decided by a Jury, while Issues of Law were to be passed on by the 
Court, and Both Types of Issues were framed 
by the Parties, and not as in Equity, extract-ed from the Pleadings by the Court. In practice, however, the Pleadings 
in Equity did not ordinarily go beyond the Replication Stage, and frequently not beyond the Answer. What really 
happened was that each Party stated all the Facts in One Pleading, 
ethough properly belonging to a Subsequent Stage of Pleading, and then these were dealt with as if stated in a 
regular series of Affirmative Pleadings in proper order. After Answer filed, the plaintiff might Amend his Bill to 
anticipate Defenses, upon the new light given him by the defendant, and the defendant, in turn, was permitted to 
make a New Answer to the Amended Bill. Thus, the Replication was actually sometimes incorporated in the Bill, 
along with the Issuable Facts 
ewhich constituted the Equity of the Eill, and which the plaintiff must prove to obtain the Relief Prayed for; and the 
defendant thereupon Rejoined with New Matter of Defense or Excuse along with his Answer. Thereafter, the 
plaintiff filed a Replication as a mere Matter of Form to place the Answer in Issue. The Bill in Equity therefore 
consisted of three parts, the Narrative, which contained a Statement of the Plaintiff’s Case for 
Relief; the Charge, which anticipated and attempted to refute the Defenses of the defendant; and the Interrogative, 
which was 
to extract from him Admissions Under Oath in his Answer. It will be observed, therefore, that the Bill and 
Answer were generally framed so as to include the evidence by which each Party sought to sustain his position or to 
defeat that of his Adversary, as well as the legal arguments and conclusions, which properly should have been 
presented in the Briefs of Counsel.°° 


On this very point of the theory of Law and Evidence, Common-Law Pleading and Procedure was vastly superior 
to the Civil Law and to the Procedure in Equity. However clearly substantive obligations and rights may be defined 
in any System of Law, there can be no security or freedom for the individual when judicially investigated, if 
competent evidence is rejected and incompetent evidence is admitted. Under the Common-Law System of reducing 
controversies to a single Issue of Fact, the Court could Rule accurately upon Offers of Evidence, admitting that 
which was proper, and rejecting that which was improper, whereas, in Equity, which adopted the Civil Law System 
of Pleadings, permitting loose, detailed Statements of Both Law and Fact, as well as Conclusions, the Issue in 
dispute was placed in such doubt that the Scope of the Evidence was so broadened as frequently to permit the 
introduction of matter wholly foreign to the real controversy. Common Law Pleading, which was designed to frame 
a certain Issue of Fact for Trial by twelve men, avoided this pitfall by indicating the character of and the limitations 
upon the evidence to be admitted. 


Relation to Code Pleading 
THE relationship between the Common Law and Code Systems as to the Structure of Pleadings has been 
largely obscured on the one hand by the Procedural Reformers who, as an incident of their objectives, have played

down the Advantages of Adjective Common Law and played up the alleged Superior Qualities of Code Procedure; 
and on the other, by the members of the Teaching Profession, who have not had the ability, or who have not taken 
the time and patience required to understand and appreciate Pleading at Common Law. But speaking of the point of 
relationship, it is clear that there are few Rules Regulating the Substance of Pleading under Modern Codes and 
Practice Acts which have not been directly borrowed from the Common Law, or framed by analogy in the appli-

cation of the same principle.” In fact, the Century following the Adoption of the Code of Procedure of New York in 
1848,~ has been one in which the Common-Law Rules have been read back into the apparently clear and simple 
provisions of the Reformed Procedure, the unadulterated truth being that such provisions had no legal content 
except as expounded against the appropriate Common Law Procedural Background. Code Pleading is not, as many 
have assumed, a System having no relation to existing law. Common-Law Pleading has not been abolished; it still 
survives as the basis of all legal investigation; it is in fact the direct Lineal Ancestor or Parent of Code Pleading, 
which literally springs from its Join. At best the Codification of Pleading is only partial, leaving wide gaps in the 
System of Remedial Law to be filled in by Common-Law Pleading, 


~t See 1 Standard Encyclopedia of Procedure, Introduction, ~ 11 (Los Angeles and Chicago, 1911). 
See, also, Solomon v. Vinson, 31 Minn, 205, 17 NW. 
340 (1883); Dunnel, Minnesota Pleading. c. I, § 9 
(1st ed. Minneapolis 1899). 


Rules of the Common-Law Pleading, as to Materiality, Certainty, Prolixity, and Obscurity, are rules of logic not abolished by the 
North Carolina Code. Crump v. Mims, 64 NC. 707, 771 (1870). The rules of pleading at Common Law have not been abrogated 
by the Code of Civil Procedure. The essential principles still remain. Henry mv. Co. v. Semonian, 40 Cob. 269, 90 P. 682

with its actual provisions interpretable only against the Older System. It becomes clear, therefore, that one can 

only come to full apprehension of Code Pleading through the study of Common-Law Pleading. 

To illustrate this point, let us take the Common Code provision that the Complaint must state facts in “plain and 
concise” language.°° To one not trained in the Common Law this means a statement of “facts,” as Charles 
O’Connor, the distinguished New York Lawyer and Pleader, observed, “just as any old woman, in trouble for the 
first time, would narrate her grievances,~’SC and whipped into some semblance of order by use of a Form Book; to 
one trained in the Common Law, it would mean that the plaintiff, in order to state a Cause of Action, or the defend- 
ant, in order to state a Defense, should state the Ultimate Facts, and not the Evidence of Facts and not Conclusions 
of Law, as pointed out in the leading New York case of Allen v. Patterson.” 

Bliss, in his famous work on Code Pleading,”” stated Rules covering presumptions of Fact, Matters Judicially 
Noticed, Anticipating Defenses, and Pleading Evidence, Conclusions of Law, or Immaterial or Irrelevant Matters. 
But in each instance the source of such Rule under the Code is Common-Law Pleading; each Rule is in effect 
merely a restatement, in slightly different phraseology, of the Rule as developed at Common Law. So, likewise, as to 
the Rules governing such matters as Duplicity, Certainty, Consistency, Directness, Argumentativeness, Allegations 
by way of Recital, and Alternative or Hypothetical Pleading. In

fact, express statutory provisions aside, it may be said that if a Lawyer, in a Complaint under the Code, frames his 
Allegations of Fact in a manner to meet with the requirements of Stating a Cause of Action or Defense at Common 
Law, he need have no fear of being thrown out of Court on Demurrer because of some Formal or Substantive Defect 
in his Pleadings.” Indeed, the prophetic words of Professor Thomas M. Cooley seem as true today as when 
originaijy written, when, in referring to the relation of the New to the Older System, he declared: 


“The works of Common Law Pleading have not been superseded by the New Codes which have been introduced. 
JA 
-careful study of these works is the very best preparation for the Pleader, as well where a Code is in force as where 
the old Common-Law Forms are still adhered to. Any expectation which may have existed that the Code was to 
banish technicality, and substitute such simplicity that any man of common un~erstanding was to be competent, 


Page 36 of 735 


without legal training, to present his case in due Form 
-of Law, has not been realized. After a trial of the Code System for many years, its friends must confess that there is 


something more than Form in the Old System of Pleading, and that the Lawyer who has learned to state his 


case in a logical manner after the Rules laid down by Stephen and Gould, is better prepared to draw a Pleading that 
will stand the test on Demurrer than the man who, without that training, undertakes to tell his story to the Court as 
he might tell it to a neighbor, but who, never having accustomed himself to a strict and logical presentation of the 
precise Facts which constitute the Legal Cause of Action or the Legal Defense, is in danger of stating so much or so 
little, or 

-of presenting the Facts so inaccurately, as to leave his rights in doubt on his own showing. Let the Common-Law 
Rules be mastered, and 


the work under the Codes will prove easy and simple, and it will speedily be seen that no time has been lost or 
labor wasted, in coming to the New Practice by the Old Road.” o4 


Relation to the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 

TOWARD the close of the Nineteenth Century, the American Bar Association concluded that Legislative Control 
of Practice was highly inefficient and that the Federal Conformity Act had produced no Real Conformity between 
State and Federal Practice. In this situation the Association placed its influence behind a bill in Congress which 
provided for turning the Federal Rule-Making Power over to the Supreme Court of the United States. After much 
agitation and much backing and filling, by the Act of June 19, i934,~ Congress gave the Supreme Court power “to 
prescribe, by General Rules, for the District Courts of the United States and for the Courts of the District of 
Columbia, the Forms of Process, Writs, Pleadings, and Motions, and the Practice and Procedure in Civil Actions at 
Law.”°° The Rules as formuJated under this Act did not modify in any way the substantive rights of litigants. The 
Act further provided that the Court might “unite the General Rules prescribed by it for Cases in Equity with those in 
Actions at Law so as to secure One Form of Civil Action and Procedure for both.” 67 The right of Trial by Jury as at 
Common Law and decl?.red by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution was preserved. 


From the nature and character of the provisions Of the Act of 1934, and the Rules of Civil Procedure as 
promulgated thereunder by the Supreme Court in 1938, it is clear that

Ch. 1 
in scope and content they were patterned after the provisions of our various State Codes and Practice Acts, 
which, as previously indicated, were founded on the fundamental principles of Common-Law Procedure. There are, 
however, two thief differences. First, under the New System in the Federal Courts and as adopted in Several States, 
the control of Pleading and Practice by Rule of Court gives a flexibility in the application of the Procedural Law 
and in its adaptation to any need for change growing out of new or unforeseen conditions, as opposed to the Older 
System of Code Pleading, which more or less placed procedure in a legislative strait-jacket, leaving little room for 
development to meet changing social conditions. Second, under the Codes, attempts to simplify and reduce the 
number of provisions regulating Pleading did not meet with success. For example, the New York Civil Practice Act 
contained some 1578 Sections, Supplemented by 301 Rules of Civil Practice. In 1938, when a comparison was made 
between the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the New York Code, it appeared that it took only 86 
Federal Rules to cover substantially the area occupied by 1100 of the 1578 sections of the Civil Practice Act and 
133 of the 301 New York Rules of Civil Practice. And finally, it may be added that the spirit and tendency of the 
New System of Procedure as represented by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and as regulated by the Judges, is 


Page 37 of 735 


in the direction of the Common Law, as is evidenced, to give but a single example, by the provision that all Actions 
must be instituted through a Clerk of a Court and by Authority of a Court, as at Common Law, as opposed to 
the Code Method of Commencing an Action by an Individual or an Attorney serving a Summons and Complaint 
upon the defendant. 


TIE STATUS OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING UNDER TIIE CODES 
Acts and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. But even after a Century of Development under the Codes 
we still find that Common-Law Pleading survives in fact or in theory. On the basis of the degree of 
Common-Law Pleading which still prevails, the states fall into five groups: 

The Common-Law States; 

The Quasi Common-Law States; 

The Code States; 

The Rules of Court States; 


Civil Law States, 


IN the early part of the Nineteenth Century the influence of Bentham began to be felt in America. By the 
New York Constitution of 1846, the Court of Chancery was abolished,~ and a New Court having General Ju- 
risdiction over Law and Equity was created and the Legislature was directed to provide for the appointment of 
Three Commissioners “to revise, reform, simplify, and abridge” the Practice and Pleadings of the Courts of Record 
of the State.” In response to this direction, in the following year the State Legislature instructed the 
Commissioners “to provide for the abolition of the present Forms of Actions and Pleadings in cases at Common 
Law; for a Uniform Course of Proceeding in all Cases whether of Legal or Equitable Cognizance, and for the 
abandonment of all Latin and other foreign tongues, so far as the same shall by them be deemed practicable, 
and of any Form and Proceeding not necessary to ascertain or preserve the Rights of the Parties.” -o Under 
the directing genius of David Dudley Field, the Commission formulated and reported a Code which was passed 
on April 12, 1848, and became operative on July 1, 1848, as the Code of Procedure,-! which has served as the 
source of most of our Modern Procedural Reform. The greatest single achievement of the Code, according 
to Professor Pomeroy, was the sub-

stitution of One Form of Action in place of the Eleven Common-Law Forms of Action-” In addition, Separate 
Courts of Law and Equity were established, in favor of what was hoped would turn out to be a Blended System of 
Procedure, operating under a Formless Action to be known as a Civil Action, which was in the nature of an 
Action on the Case. The Code also provided the Pleadings should state the Facts in plain and concise 
language,’* and that the more liberal provisions of Equity Procedure should govern Joinder of Parties, and 
provided for the rendition of Judgments against one or more Parties according to the particular interest of the 
Parties involved. 


Within a quarter of a century after the adoption of the New York Code of Procedure in 1848, the Code was 
adopted in twenty-four States, and, according to Clark,” some Form of Code Procedure was, in 1947, then in force 
in twenty-nine states, two territories, the District of Columbia, and in the Federal Courts. So, even at this late date, 
it still remains true that the Movement for Reform, which took definite shape In 1848, has been only 


Page 38 of 735 


partially effective. Prior to the adoption of the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, the States 
were roughly lined up in Four Groups, being classified as CommonLaw, Quasi.Common-Law, Code and 
Civil Law States. After 1938, there may be added another Group, the Rules of Court States. Perhaps a 
brief word concerning each type of Jurisdiction may be helpful. 


i'he Common-Law States 
BY the phrase “Common-Law States,” is meant those States in which the Pleading is

primarily according to the Common-Law Rules, as Unwritten Law or in the Form of Statutory Enactment of 
the Common Law. Characteristic of the Procedure of the States which fall into this Group is the retention of the 
Forms of Actions and the Rules of Common-Law Pleading under a Court System that still calls for Separate Actions 
at Law and Suits in Equity. Even so, the Practice in these Separate Courts has from time to time been modified by 
Local Practice Acts. 


The Quasi Common-Law States 

IN these States the Formal Distinction between Law and Equity has been continued at least in theory, 
although in practice it has been weakened by Statutes abolishing the distinctions between Trespass and Trespass on 
the Case, or combining the Forms of Actions in the two divisions of Tort arid Contract. Usually in Jurisdictions 
of tins character Equitable Defenses are permitted in Law Actions. 


The Code States 

IN the Code States, originally largely patterned ‘after the New York Code of Procedure, the Systems of 
Pleading and Practice are Statutory, but based on a combination of the better features of the Common-Law and 
Equity Procedural Systems. The same Rules apply to both Law and Equity Cases. But it should be remembered that 
there is a far greater similarity in the essential principles of Pleading at Common Law, in Equity, and under the 
Reformed Code of Procedure than is generally realized. The Essential Elements of Causes of Action which 
must be Pleaded are not changed by the Codes. And the Rules as to the manner of making Allegations of the 
respective contentions of the Parties still have much in common. 


Rules of Court States 

THESE states are distinguished front the Code States, whose Pleading and Practice is generaily, if not 
entirely, Re~ulated by the Legislature, in that their Procedure is Reg 
26 

BASIS OF MODERN REMEDIAL LAW 
Ch. I 

ulated by Rules of Court, usually framed by or under the authority of the Court of Highest Jurisdiction-.---the 
Supreme Court. The advantage of Regulating Procedure by Rule of Court as opposed to Legislative Enactment 
is that of greater flexibility in making changes as the social need therefor arises, without the necessity of 
each time referring the matter to a Legislative Body, which may be dilatory in taking action, and is 
oftentimes influenced by political considerations. Since the promulgation of the New Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, a number of states have adopted the substance of the New Rules in revising their procedure. 


Civil Law States 

In this group the Systems of Pleading were originally based upon the Civil as opposed to the Common Law. 
Louisiana is a remaining State which began with a Civil Law background, from which it has never fully 
escaped. 


Page 39 of 735 


Conclusion 

ASIDE from the fact that after the lapse of over a Century, almost a third of the Several States of the 
United States were yet to accept the Reform represented by the adoption of a Code of Civil Procedure, how have 
the codes been received? The object was to blend Law and Equity into a Uniform Mode of Procedure. This was to 
be accomplished by abolition of the Forms of Action and the Distinction between Law and Equity. A single Form of 
Action in the nature of an Action on the Case was to be substituted in place of the Common-Law Forms of Actions 
and Suits in Equity. In some Codes there were also provisions liberalizing the law controlling Joinder of Parties 
and Joinder of Causes of Action, but unfortunately many of the early Codes omitted the latter type of provision. 


In some States, notably New York, the Reforms under the Code of Procedure, met with 
a cold reception.” Thus in Reubens v. Joel,” Selden, - in referring to the possibility of abolishing the 
distinctions between Law and Equity, declared: “By what process can these two Modes of Relief be made 
indentical? It is possible to abolish one or the other, or both, but it certainly is not possible to abolish the 
distinction between them. 
Another leading distinction between Common-Law Actions and Suits in Equity consists in their different 
Modes of Trial. The former are to be tried by a Jury, the latter by the Court. Can the Legislature abolish 
this distinction? They might, but for the restraints of the Constitution, abolish either kind of Trial, or 
reclassify the classes to which they apply; but they cannot make Trial by Jury and Trial by the Court the 
same thing.” r~ 

What such an attitude has meant in practical terms is that a large part of the Century following the 
adoption of the First Codes has been spent by the Judges in reading back into the Code, provision by 
provision, the Rules of the Common Law. 


According to Clark,” the objections of the Courts which have taken an unfriendly attiTa chief Justice 
Winslow of Wisconsin, said: “The 

cold, not to say inhuman, treatment which the infant code received from the New York Judges Is matter of history. They had 
been bred under the Common-Law Rules of Pleading and taught to regard that System as the perfection of logic, and they 
viewed with suspicion a system which was heralded as so simple that every man would be able to draw his own Pleadings. 
They proceeded by construction to import into the Code Rules and distinctions from the Common-Law System to such an 
extent that in a few years they had practically so changed it that it could hardly be recognized by its creators.” MeArthur v. Moffet, 143

tude toward the Code Reforms, are five in number: 


(1) The necessity of forming clear and exact issues, both for the Trial and also to support the Judgment and 
thus make the Plea of Res Judicata thereafter available to the Parties. 

(2) Inherent differences as to Jurisdiction and Venue, referring to the fact that Certain Actions must 
be brought in Certain Courts or at Certain Places. 

(3) Inherent differences as to the application of Certain Statutes, such as Statutes of Limitations which 
were drawn along the lines of the old Procedural Divisions. 

(4) Inherent differences in Manner or Amount of Relief to be granted, referring to the Specific Relief 
of Equity as distinguished from the Money Damages ordinarily given at Law; or to a possible Variance in 
the Amount of Money Damages recoverable, depending on the Form of Action chosen; or to Particular 
Remedies granted only in Certain Forms of Actions, such as Execution on the defendant’s body. 

(5) Inherent differences in Manner of “Trial and of Appellate Review, referring to the Constitutional 


Page 40 of 735 


Right of Trial by Jury in “Law Cases” and to the different Methods of Appellate Review in “Law” and 
“Equity” cases. 

Ail these problems have, with a more liberal point of view on the part of the Judges, been satisfactorily 
solved in other Code States, according to Judge Clark, and it was his belief that in time the Courts in New 
York would come around to the same view. But the very existence of the objections enumerated by Judge 
Clark ninety-nine years after the adoption of the New York Code of Procedure in 1848, plus the fact that 
numerous States are still without the Circle of Reform, is some slight indication of the tenacity of the 
Common Law. And when you add to this the fact that the great bulk of the decisions under the Codes 
have necessarily been made against the background of the Common Law, it becomes clear why many distinguished 
Judges cling to the thesis that the inherent and fundamental difference between Actions at Law and Suits in 
Equity cannot be ignored—a view which has found the support, at least, of one distinguished teacher,” who 
stated, in referring to the Abolition of the Forms, that they “are not archaic, accidental, artificial or arbitrary, but 
in the nature of things reasonable, if not indeed in their essence necessary.” ~- 


MODERN PROCEDURE UNDER CODES, 
PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF 
COURT—MERELY ANOTHER STEP IN 
THE EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE COMMON LAW 


7. Viewed in its proper Historical Perspective, any unbiased and well-informed Student of Legal History, 
Generally, and of Legal Procedure, Specifically, must observe that each new advance in our System of Procedure was and is 
but another Evolutionary Step in the Development of the Common Law, and must acknowledge the fact that 
Common-Law Pleading, after the passage of some Seven or Eight Centuries, still survives as the basis of 
our Modern Legal Procedural Systems as they exist in both the State and Federal Courts. 


HAVE the developments which have taken place since 1848, under the various Codes of Civil Procedure, 
and the Practice Acts of the Several States, together with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, been 
Revolutionary in Character, wiping out the Ancient Landmarks of the Common Law and the procedural 
experience of the Anglo-Saxon race, extending over a period of over eight hundred years, or rather, have they 
been merely gradual steps in the Evolutionary Development of Common-Law Pleading and Practice?

issued out of Chancery in great profusion, creating New Rights and New Law. It was during this period that the 
Ancient Proprietary and Possessory Real Actions developed in great number. 


Alter the Provisions o Oxford in 1258, the power of the Clerks in Chancery was restricted, the Real and Mixed 
Actions became so highly technical, difficult to manage and 
lengthy in process, that they became inflexible and in consequence the Common Law lost some of its inherent 
power of expansion. During this period of inflexibility, an effort fo restore the Authority of the Clerks in Chancery 
was made so that they might again Create New Rights by Issuing New Writs under Chapter 24 of the Statute of 
Westminster II (1285). But the effort was too little and came too late, so that the Residuary Power of the 
King’s Council, operating through Chancery, was invoked to supplement the Common Law, not necessarily be- 
cause of the Defects in the Common Law, but rather for reasons of State Policy. 


As a result of the Statute perhaps, but more as a result of the growing social, economic and mercantile needs of 
England, the Modern Personal Common-Law Actions, which to some extent ran parallel to the Ancient 


Page 41 of 735 


Proprietary and Possessory Actions, and which were gradually emerging into greater prominence with 
the decline of these actions, were substituted in lieu of the old Real Actions which had predominated 
during the early Developmental Period of the Common Law. In the course of time, these Modem 
Forms of Action, latest in point of growth, in the Third State of Development, were abolished in favor of 
a Single, Formless, Form of Action, under which remedies could be provided for the violation of pri- 
vate rights of most any character. 


With this in mind, let us swiftly glance back over the territory covered, and with almost a thousand 
years perspective in mind, view the Present Status of Common-Law 
Pleading and Practice as it stands in the light of Modem Reforms. 


From the Reign of Edward I (1272-4307) to 1848, a Period of five hundred and seventy-six years elapsed, during 
which Period, in both England and the United States, Legal Procedure was governed by the Common Law. When, in 
England, the Modern Common-Law Actions were substituted in the place of the Old Real Actions, as is later 
observed,” it was assumed that such an occurrence was merely a Normal Evolutionary Development of the 
Common Law, based upon the change in the English social structure from One of a Feudal to One of a 
Commercial or Industrial Character. This change became official or was Procedurally recognized by the 
Real Property Limitations Act of 1833,~~ which abolished the Real and Mixed Actions. 


When, therefore, in 1848, the New York Code of Procedure attempted to obliterate the distinctions 
between Law and Equity, to abolish the Common-Law Actions and to substitute in lieu thereof the 
Modem Single Formless Form of Action, the World was witnessing, not a Revolutionary Reform which swept 
the Common-Law System from its Ancient Moorings, but merely a Third Step in the Evolutionary Development of 
Common-Law Procedure, like that which took place in the Roman System. 

Between 1848 and 1947, according to Clark,*? only twenty-eight out of the forty- 
eight States followed New York in establishing Code Systems of Procedure. And in those States which did

definition thereof. It has always seemed that this was to put the cart before the hone, that no understandable effort to 
define what is meant by the phrase “Forms of Action” could be made except as against a somewhat detailed survey 
of the History of the Common-Law Forms of Action, both Ancient and Modern. To present a definition to the 
student at a time when he has no apperceptive background or conception of how the Forms of Action 
developed, would appear to be an almost fruitless effort. In any event, it is respectfully submitted that the viewpoint 
of one who is seeking an understanding of the Forms of Action should be one of realization that the “Common-Law 
Scheme of Actions was not framed; it grew.” ~ 


ORIGIN OF THE COMMON-LAW FORMS OF ACTION 


& The Common-Law Forms of Action had their Origin In the Action and Inter-action which 
took place between the Chancellor and 
the Three Royal Courts, King’s Bench, Exchequer and Ctmmon Pleas, whereby individual litigants applied to the 
Chancery for Original Writs authorizing one of the three Courts to try a Specific ActIon. The 
Multiplication of this Process first produced the Ancient Real, Mixed and Personal Common-Law 
Actions, which later were superseded by the Modern Common-Law Actions. 


HOW, then, did the Formulary System of the Common Law develop the Ancient and Modem Common-Law 
Forms of Action? And why is a knowledge of what was meant by the phrase “Forms of Action” essential to one 
who seeks to understand the Law?

The answer to these inquiries can only be discovered and understood against the background of the Norman 
Conquest and the statesmanship of William the Conqueror, who operating through the King’s Council or Curia 
Regis, the King’s writ, the King’s Inquest and the doctrine of the King’s peace, did three things which left an 
indelible imprint upon English Legal History, In the first place, he organized the System of Feudal Tenure under 
which, in legal theory at least, land was held in some form under the King, which explained why the King’s Courts 
were always keenly interested in any litigation, public or private, which affected land. In the second place, he issued 
in 1072 what is now known as the Ordinance of William the Conqueror,* which separated the Ecclesiastical and 
Common-Law Courts. This development not only exercised a profound influence upon the Procedural and 
Substantive Law of Descent and Distribution, Wills and Testaments and Probate and Administration, but by 
reason of the fact that it left Jurisdiction over Freehold Estates in the Common-Law Courts, it was largely 
responsible for the subsequent necessity of classifying the Common-Law Actions as Real, Mixed and Personal. 
In the third place, he established Law and Order through the creation of a Centralized System of justice, as an 
incident of which the Common-Law Forms of Action were developed. 


The agencies by or through which these things were done were, in the beginning, the King’s private 


property, and they were not at first National Institutions, nor were they a part of the Regular Machinery 
of Administration. The Nation was governed by the

Customary Local Law, which was Administered in the Local Hundred, Shire and County Courts. There the best 
Brand of Justice was not always available. Perceiving this condition William, in the process of political 
reorganization of the whole country, began creating a System of Royal, Superior Courts, to which those not satisfied 
with the Local Courts, might repair. And it was through the operation of these New Courts under William the 
Conqueror [1066—1087], Henry I [1100—1135], Henry’s grandson, Henry It 1154—1189], and Edward I [1272— 
1307], that the Centralization of Justice was achievedA 


The Courts in Which, the Forms of Action Developed 

An action could be instituted in each of the Three Superior Royal Courts, King’s Bench, Exchequer, and 
Common Pleas, each presided over by four Judges. Jurisdiction was distributed as follows; The Court of King’s 
Bench exercised control over Crimes, Torts Akin to Crimes, and Other Business Pertaining to the Crown, Matters 
of Revenue Excepted; the Court of Exchequer handled cases relating to taxation and Revenue; while the Court of 
Common Pleas dealt with Ordinary Civil Suits between subject and subject, known as communia placita. In the 
Three-cornered Struggle for Jurisdiction, 


6- ‘For most matters affecting the mass of the nation the Ancient System of Customary Law arid ~ cal Courts was continued in effect. 
Modification was for the most part not sudden or revolutionary, but the result of a long process of growth. Speaking very 
generally, it may be said that there was a time of political reorganization under William the Con~uoror (1006—IOST) and his son Henry 
I (1100— 1135), of legal Innovation and creation under Henry’s able grandson Henry II (1154—11S9), of rapid legal growth during the 
long reign Of Henry Ili (1216—1272), and of legal consolidation and eonstt-uction under hdward I, the “English Justinian” 
(1272—]307J. The account which follows will be materially aided by keeping in mind the names of these kings and the dates 
of their reigns.” Bownina, Handbook of Elementary Law, c. 10, 80, 152 (St. 1.’aul 1029). 

King’s Bench, by resort to a Fictitious Allegation of Trespass wider which control of the defendant could be 

secured by an arrest, expanded its Jurisdiction at the expense of the other Two Courts in a manner so as to include 

all Personal Actions. By a similar process of usurpation the Court of Exchequer also came to exercise Jurisdiction 
over Personal actions, but the Jurisdiction of neither Court extended to the cognizance of Real and Mixed Actions. 

In the meantime the Court of Common Pleas continued to exercise its Original Jurisdiction, which included the 

authority to entertain All Actions between the subjects of the King, Real, Mixed, or Personal, such as the Ancient 

Proprietary Writs of Right, the Possessory Assizes, Writs of Entry and Writs of Entry and Forcible Detainer, or 

such Modern Actions as Account, Covenant, Debt and Detinue, then in existence, and in time, over those Personal 

Actions of later vintage, 


In King’s Bench and Common Pleas an Action could be commenced either by an Original Writ or by Bill; 
in Exchequer, by Bill only. The Former Method of Commencing an Action, according to Stephen, “is the regular 
and ancient one, and the latter is in the nature of an exception to it. The proceeding by Original Writ 
consequently claims first notice.” ~ 


The Original Writ 

(I) The Historical Rack graund.—When the Conqueror first took over in England, in the process of 
establishing Law and Order, he followed the Norman system of having his Secretary, the Chancellor, write out and 
dispatch various Administrative Orders concerned with the execution of the business of the Crown. The King 
summoned his Army by Writ, instructed his Ambassadors by Writ, and it was under an order or orders of this

character that the facts were gathered for the Domesday Book.’ As the Authority of the King was more 
frequently exercised, it gradually and naturally fell into regular Administrative Channels, and there was a dis- 
tinct tendency to develop standards or Common Forms for handling the King’s business. When, therefore, in 
pursuance of the Conqueror’s announced policy of non-interference with the Local Courts, an effort was made to 
aid the Administration of Justice by creating a System of Royal Courts to which Litigants, who Failed to Secure Jus- 
tice in the Local Courts, might repair, it was only normal and natural that the existing System of Administrative 
Controls should be applied to the conduct of the King’s business in the Courts. It is not surprising to find, therefore, 
that as each of the Superior Common Law Courts split off from the Curia Regis or King’s Council, its activities 
were strictly limited to only those cases which were delegated to it by means of an Administrative Order, which, 
when applied to Judicial Affairs, became a Judicial Administrative Order, now familiarly known as an Original 
Writ (breve originale). Under Henry It (1154—1189), the use of such Writs, which had been occasional and 
extraordinary, perhaps a royal favor, became usual and regular. 


(U) The Depends~we of Right upon Bernedy.—In the beginning these Judicial Orders, representing the 
King, were issued only occasionally, perhaps in aid of some great tenant of the King. But later, when it became 
necessary or desirable to expand the activities of the King’s Courts, all that needed to be done was to expand and 
develop New Forms of what were, in the beginning, merely thought of as new routines in the Process of Judicial 
Administration. In Glanvill’s

England (Cambridge 1901) 
time [1178—1189] -the tendency of the Royal Courts, King’s Bench, Exchequer and Common Pleas, to enlarge 
their Jurisdictions was not great. In Bracton’s day [1245—1267] however, the period of growth was definitely under 
way, and the Procedural Mechanism by which this was to be rcalized was to be through the Invention of New Forms 
of Actions, to be, as he suggested, as numerous as there were Causes of Actions, under which the King was to 
Administer a System of Law as broad in its scope and variety as the Roman Law. The Common-Law theory that 
wherever there is a wrong there is a Remedy 9 was in effect given expression even at this early date when it was 
declared that there ought to be a remedy for every wrong; if some new wrong be perpetrated then a New Writ may 
be invented to meet it. 


The Forms of Action, therefore, constitute 
a vivid illustration of the dependence of 
right upon remedy. The question of whether 
a man could bring this or that Action, such 


8. During the latter part of the Reign of Henry II (1154—1189), the first systematic treatise of English Law appeared. The exact date of Its 
appearance is not known, but it is generally thought to have been somewhere around 1187—1180. And it has been attributed to Banulf de 
Gianviil, Henry’s great Chief Justielar. According to 1 Pollock and Maitland, flistory of English Law, Bk. J, c. v, 143 (Cambridge 
1893), the author may have been his nephew, Hubert Walter, who may have written under Glanvill’s direction. In any 
event, he produced the first authoritative story of the Development of Procedural and Substantive Common Law, as evolved 
by the 
Lawyers and Judges, under the reforming energy of Henry II, Maitland and Montague, A Sketch of English Legal History, c. I, 43 (New 
York 1915), in commenting on this book, declared: “We look back from it to a law book written in the reign of Henry I (1100—1135), [the 
Leges Henrici Primci, written about 1115J, and we can hardly believe that only some seventy years divide the two. The one can, at this 
moment, be read and understood by anyone who knows a little of Medieval Latin and a little of English Law; the other will always be dark 
to the most Learned Scholars. The gulf between them looks like that between Logic and Caprice. between Reason and Unreason.”

as Trespass, Trover, Assumpsit, and so on, was a question of Substantive Right and of Liability. Jn theory, as has 
been suggested, there ought to be a remedy for every wrong (ubi jus, ibi renwdium), yet the Right of Action at

Common Law was dependent upon whether the litigants’ facts fell within the scope of a limited and arbitrary list of 
Writs. There were at any given moment of development—a development which stretched over Centuries—only the 
same number of Rights of Action as there were Forms of Action. These Forms of Action, Ancient and Modern, 
persisted in actual use in English Procedure for Six Centuries, from the time of Henry TI [1154—1189] and 
Edward I [1272—1307], until the Judicature Acts «in the Nineteenth Century. And these Forms were issued, and 
from time to time, found their way into and were permanently recorded in the Chancery in a book known as the 
Register of Writs”

(Regisirurn Brevium) . which was first printed and published in the Reign of Henry VIII [1509—1547]. This 
book thus became an authoritative source I or the purpose of determining, at any given moment in English Legal 
History, what Forms of Writs were then available to litigants. A variation, however, from the transcript of the 
Form as it appeared in the Register, was not conclusive against the propriety of the Form, if it appeared correct 
from other sufficient authority adduced. 


Thus, the King’s Court was even then in the throes of developing a Formulary System through which it was 
ultimately destined to establish a Broad, General, National Jurisdiction and approximate the Common-Law ideal 
of affording a litigant a remedy for every wrong. This type of activity applied mostly to Civil Pleas or Common 
Pleas, whereas Pleas to the Crown, criminal for most part, depended upon a System of Procedure controlled by the 
Local Authorities. These Civil Pleas originally were Pleas dealing with the land, as under the Feudal System the 
crown was concerned with maintaining strict control over the land, as a result of which the Common Law 
Regulating the Land was ultimately to be converted into the Common Law of the Land. While in general these 
disputes might also have been handled by the Local Courts, where the Feudal Court was either weak, partial or 
actually corrupt, a Writ might issue from the King, through the Chancellor, ordering the Feudal Lord to 
do immediate Justice or appear in the King’s Court on a certain day and explain why not. In the beginning 
such intervention was largely administrative in character, and such threats, for the purpose of setting the 
Local Lord’s Judicial Machinery in motion, were not without both Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman precedent. 


were wide differences. 2 Pol)ock and Maitland, History of English Law, Bk. II, c. IX, rrocedure, § 1, 562, 568 (Cambridge 
1895).

Collected Papers, 110 (Edited by H. A. Fisher, Cambridge 1911). 


The purpose of the Register of Writs was to provide the Clerics in Chancery with an authoritative collection of Forms for all the existing 
Writs. It also served as a guide to Lawyers as to what Writs were available in the Chancellor’s omce. Maitiand, in his article on The 
History of the Original Writs, 3 Ilarv.LRev. 97, 107 (1889), reprinted in 2 Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History, e. 36, 549 
(Boston 1908), declared that the Register grew and expanded over a period of some Three Centuries, during which time its 57cc 
constantly increased. Long after the period of its greatest development had passed it appeared in print for the first time in what is 
known as A Collection of Rastell’s Entries, first published in 1596. 4 Reel-es, History of English Law, e. XXX, Henry VIII, 566 
(Am. ed. by Finlasen, Philadelphia 1880). For some Two Centuries thereafter this book and others based upon it were among the 
commonplace books used by the Practicing Lawyers. Such books took the Form of Commentaries by Judges and text- 
writers upon the character and use of the Writs available in the Begister. These Writs, if the variations in each one were noted, reached 
Into the hundreds; if, however, we omit the variations, the number may be estimated at thirty or forty between which there

(ID) The Creation of the First Origina’ Writ and Its Three Purpose&—However this may be, if for a 

moment we retrace our steps, there must have been a time, immediately after the First Superior Common-Law 

Court was differentiated from the King’s Council, when the first litigant petitioned the Chancellor for 

Relief, let us say, based upon a claim that his title or possession to certain property was in jeopardy. 

Where title or a proprietary interest was involved, the Remedy required was some Form of the Writ of Right, but 

where a mere possessory interest was in question the Remedy consisted of a Possessory Writ, which later was fol- 

lowed by the Writ of Trespass (quare ckiuaum fregit) and the Writ of Ejeetment. Now, for the first time, the

Chancellor was confronted with the problem of just how he would delegate to the then single existing Court the 
required Authority of the King which was essential f or the Court to function or to hear the Complaint contained 
in the Petition to the Chancellor. At this point the Chancellor, faced with the Concrete problem of framing a Judicial 
Order for the first time, doubtless looked over the Forms of some of his Non-Judicial Administrative Or- 
ders, observed that they usually began with greetings from the King and were directed to the individual 
whose action was sought. Adopting such Nonjudicial Order as a pattern, but phrasing it in Judicial Language, and 
directing it to the Sheriff of the County where the Cause of Action arose, or to the defendant, he thus created the 
First Original 
Writ, the Beginning and Foundation of the 
Suit, the exact date of which is buried in the mists of history. 

After the first Original Writ of Trespass guare clausum Ire git (Trespass to Land), as referred to above, had 
been issued several times to cover that Specific Factual Situation, it gradually acquired a Fixed Form and 
a Fixed Theory of Liability. If, however, the petitioner appeared in Chancery with a Complaint that his cattle 
had been taken 
and carried away, the First Writ did not fit the Factual Situation, hence the Chancellor or his Clerks had to 
Frame a New Writ to cover a Trespass to personal property. Looking over the Form of the Writ of Trespass 
quare c7ausun’~ fregit, the Chancellor doubtless discovered that by changing the description of the 
property involved from realty to personally, he could accomplish the desired end of authorizing the proper 
Court to try the case. Thus was created the Writ of Trespass to Personalty (Trespass tie bonis asportatis) - 
And so with another slight variation in the language of the Two Preceding Writs, he was able to bring 
forth the Writ of Trespass for Assault and Battery. Pursuing the same thought, if the Complaint was that the 
defendant had failed to pay the plaintiff a sum certain due and owing, a Writ of Debt was framed; if the 
Complaint was that the defendant had breached the terms of a Sealed Contract, a Writ of Covenant was the 
plaintiff’ s only remedy. And so on, until by a similar process, the whole gamut of human activity was in a 
manner covered, and there developed in the Common Law a great multieiplicity of Types of Actions, as 
almost all types of injury, whether involving Breach of a Contract, Injury to Person or Injury to Property, 
occurred under slightly different combinations of Facts or Events, making with each variation a New Writ, the 
issuance of which created a New Right. 


An Original Writ, according to Blackstone, was a mandatory letter on parchment, issuing out of Chancery, 
under the Great Seal, in the King’s name, directed to the Sheriff of the County where the injury was alleged to 
have occurred, containing a Summary Statement of the Cause of Action, and requiring the defendant to satisfy 
the claim, or upon the defendant’s failure to do so, then to Summon him to appear in the designated 
Superior Common-Law Court on the day named in the Writ, It was a kind of Judicial ~xecutive 
Order to show cause why he had not redressed the wrong complained of. In

some cases it omitted the former alternative, and required the Sheriff simply to enforce an Appearance. 
Examples of the Form of such a Writ, in one of the Ancient Real Actions and in one of the Modern 
Personal Actions, the relationship of which will be developed later, appear below:

In other words, the Writs were not transformed into Actions until, in pursuance of the authority granted 
therein, the defendant Appeared in Court. At that time the plaintiff, elaborating upon the Charge Stated in the 
Original Writ, filed his Declaration stating for the first time his Cause of Action, in the course of which he not only 
repeated the Charge in the Original Writ, but expanded it into a full-fledged Statement of his Cause of Action. The 
issuance of each New Writ with each new variation in the Combination of Facts or Events presented amounted, 
thes~efore, to the creation of a New Cause or Right of Action.” 


At this point, therefore, it should be observed, that the Original Writ as finally 


I~ It was this very practice, as we shall see, which led the Barons in 7258 to draw up what are now known as the Provisions of Oxford, which 
bad a restrictive effect upon the practice of the Clerks in Chancery in issuing New Writs. It was this restriction upon the Clerks which 


ultimately led to the Enactment of the Statute of Westminster 11 (1285), 13 Edw. I, c. 24, 1 Pickering’s Statutes at Lar-ge 196, under which 
the Clerks were authorized to issue New Writs in all cases similar to but not Identical with Trespasses, provided they fell within the 
scope of some existing Writ; otherwise the mutter was to be referred to Parliament

developed, served three distinct and material purposes: 


(1) It authorized a specific Superior Common-Law Court to acquire control over the specific 
individuals involved in the controversy, or to put the matter in more technical phraseology, it gave the Court 
Jurisdiction over the Parties to the Action. 


(2) it authorized the same Court to assume control over the controversy, or to put the matter in more technical 


language, it gave the court Jurisdiction over the Subject Matter of the Action and served as the Institution of 
the Action. 


Page 50 of 735 


(3) It determined the Character of the Action to be tried, for if the plaintiff sued out of Chancery an 
Original Writ in Debt, he could not declare in Account, Covenant, or any other Form of Action but Debt. 
The Character of the Writ definitely defined and limited the Character of the Action. 


In short, except in the case of the Practice of Proceeding by Bill, no Action could be begun in any 
Superior Court without the express sanction of an Original Writ, the general effect of which was to confer 
Jurisdiction on the Specific Court in which it directed the defendant to Appear. This suing out of an 
Original Writ, the first step in the Commencement of an Action was, as we have seen, taken by the plaintiff, 
to whom it was available as a matter of course, upon the payment of a fee 14 to the King, the size of the fee being in 
proportion to the amount demanded by way of Damages in the action. The cost of these fees, therefore, became 
a continuing and ever-increasing source of the King’s revenue, and constitutes one explanation of the Crown’s 
unfailing interest in the Administration of Justice. The net effect

1801), and for a full explanation of the subject of Pines, consult Bellon, Practice In the Courts of King’s Bench, Introduction, xl-xliv 
(London 1798). 

of all this was to make the King “the fountain of justice,” and his Writ the Foundation of the Jurisdiction of the 

Court.’ 


(IV) The Relation of the Charge in the Original Writ to the Charge in the Declaration —In considering the 
Early Developmental Stages of the Writ System, it is well to keep in mind three things: 


The first is the significance of the Writ Process as a device f or “making a pathway for the Jurisdiction of the 
King’s Court.” «~ 


The second is that the Earlier Writs of course (Writs “de cursu”), which existed long prior to the time when the 
Actions of Trespass on the Case came into being and operation, ‘were not,” as Bigelow observes,’’ “created by a 
stroke of the pen, or imported into perfect form from Normandy,” but though of Continental origin, “they were 
gradually developed on English soil, out of rough and even shapeless material.” If this fact be well understood, it 
will clearly appear that the Common-Law Forms of Action antecedent to and therefore necessarily not founded 
upon the Statute of Westminster II (1285), did not arise out of the Writ; that originally it was “entirely foreign to any 
purpose of the Writ to set forth tha Formal Language of an Action.” 18 


This brings us to the third thing which must be kept in mind, to wit, the relation of the Charge in the Original 
Writ to the Charge in the Declaration, at the Various Stages in the Development of the Writ Process. In the 
beginning apparently there was no connection between the Original Writ and the Declaration. According to 
Bigelow, as pointed out above, originally it was not the Function of the Original Writ to set

forth the Charge contained therein in the technical form or language of a full-fledged Cause of Action; it was 
required to include a definite statement of the subject matter or Cause of Action, as the defendant was entitled to be 
apprised of the plaintiff’ s demand, in order that he might prepare himself to meet it intelligently. And when the sum- 
mons was thus accomplished by virtue of the authority of the Writ, the actual service was made by the “good 
summoners” ref erred to in the Forms of the Old Writs, and their knowledge of the Cause of Action necessarily 
must have been obtained from the Original Writ. It has been suggested that the oldest Common Law Forms of 
Action are a direct lineal descendent of the (3cr-manic formulae of Pre-Norman and Norman England; and that the 
Writ, which is of ancient origin, and the Count, which has a long record reaching back to the Anglo-Saxon time of 


Page 51 of 735 


Alfred, were originally two separate forces operating independently of each other, but which, nevertheless, were 
gradually converging, until by the time of Glanvill (1178—1189) they were approaching a point of contact, which 
however, was not completed until the next, or Thirteenth Century. Once this convergence was completed, it 
is clear that in time the Writ came to control both the Form of the Action as well as the Statement of the Cause of 
Action contained therein. 


(V) Necessity of Selecting the Correct Form of Writ.—When the plaintiff petitioned the Chancellor for an 
Original Writ, he was under great pressure to select the right Writ for the facts of his case. He chose at his own 
persona! peril. If he selected a Form of Writ which did not fit his case, however just his grievance might be, he 
could not succeed. Thus, if he sued out a Writ of Debt and his Complaint was that he had been evicted from 
Blackacre, for which he should have sought a Writ of Ejeetment, the case would be dismissed, If he sued out 
a Writ 

of Replevin for a wrongful taking of Personal Property, he could not recover in Special Assumpsit for Breach 
of a Contract. In each instance where he selected the Wrong Form of Writ, his only recourse would be to 
retrace his steps and start over, selecting a Writ appropriate to the character of his Complaint. Referring to this 
characteristic of the Common-Law Forms of Action, Pal-lock and Maitland compared the System to an Armory, 
declaring: “It contains every species of medieval weapon from a two handed sword to the poinard. The man who 
has a quarrel with his neighbor comes hither to choose his weapon. The choice is large; but he must remember that 
he will not be able to change weapons in the middle of the combat and also that every weapon has its proper 
use and may be put to none other. If he selects a sword, he must observe the rules of sword-play; he must not try to 
use his cross-bow as a mace.” 


‘9. 2 Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, Bk. II, c. IX, Procedure, ~ 1, 559 (Cambridge 1895). 


And Professor Hepburn, in his work, The Historical Development of Code Pleading c. Ii, § 46, 47—48 (Cincinnati, 1897), 
declared: “If a wrong Actiou was adopted, the Error was fatal to the whole proceeding, however clearly the Facts of the 
Controversy might have been brought before the proper Court. The plaintiff may have served his Adversary in due time, and 
may have given as full Information as to the Material Facts of the Case as could be given in any other Action; he may hare 
proceeded openly and fairly in all matters; there may have been no question as fo the substantial Justice of his claim; but all this would 
not avail if his Action was not technically the proper one. Be must pay the costs and go out of Court. If he chose, he could begin again, 
but under like conditions. At his peril he must select the appropriate formula. It was not enough that he stood within the 
Temple of Justice, he must have entered through a particular door. Or, to change the figure, Chancery, the so-called 
offiebu, justitiac, was like an armory. To It every man who would contend with another in the Courts comes to choose 
his weapon. The choice is large. All the weapons of Juridical Warfare are here. But every weapon has Its proper use, and can be 
put to no other. Moreover, only one weapon can be chosen at a time; and once chosen It cannot be exchanged for a different weapon In the 
progress of the combat. It the ~ght Is to go on, It must be with

(VI) The Power to Issue New Varieties of Original Writs.—The Chancellor was the King’s Secretary of State, 

and as such was long the most powerful Officer of the Government, having his hand in most of the business of the 

Kingdom. This resulted from the fact that he was the Keeper of the Great 


Seal which had to be impressed upon Official Documents, and from the fact that any Administrative Orders of the 
King were usually prepared under his personal supervision. And, in this connection, it should be remembered that 
the Conquest introduced into England the Norman principle that no individual or institution could act for the King or 
his Council unless authority to do so had been delegated to him. When, therefore, the Superior Common Law Courts 
were differentiated from the King’s Council, and the problem arose of delegating to them the authority to act in each 
case, naturally the Chancellor and his Clerks, skilled in drafting Executive Orders for the King, became responsible 
for the preparation of Writs authorizing the Royal Courts to try Specific Cases which fell within their Jurisdiction. 
At first the Writs were probably awarded according to Abstract Conceptions of Justice and the needs of the 
case, but later only according to Precedent. And these Original Writs almost from the beginning differed from each 
other according to the nature of the Plaintiff’ s Complaint and the ground of the Defendant’s Liability. Unless 
the plaintiff s Complaint

followed. A erossbow may not be used as a mace. The issue of the combat must not be determined by mere brute force—not even 
by the brute force of indisputable facts arrayed before the Court. It is a contest of skill; success depends upon observing the formal 
rules of the combat,” 

In this connection, Blackstone referred to the Chancery as “the oil icing fustitiae, the shop or mint of Justice, wherein all the King’s writs 
are framed.” Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of $Ingland, ]300k III, c. XIV, Of the Pursuit of Remedies by Action, 
756 (Chase’s Am. ed., New York, 1517). 


fell within the scope of an Existing Form of Action, or unless the Chancellor saw fit to Issue a New Writ, the 
plaintiff could not maintain any Action at Law. 


For approximately a hundred years from the institution of the Writ System to the early part of the Thirteenth 
Century, the King’s general power to formulate and issue New Writs through the Chancellor seems to have been 
unquestioned. In consequence the Law, as developed in the King’s Courts, between 1154—1250, underwent a 
tremendous growth. The power to make New Writs was a power to create New Rights, and hence New Law. 
Thus the Chancery became the principal instrument by which Justice was gradually Centralized in the Crown. It 
became not only the “Shop of Justice,” but also the “Mother of Actions.” To the Chancery must apply all those 
seeking relief, to which the language of some known Writ was applicable, or for some New Writ, framed on the 
analogy of those already in existence. Writs thus issued as a matter of routine were known as “writs of course.” 

And as new social needs arose and as the political status of the country permitted, New Writs were hammered out 
on the anvil of Justice in the Shop of the Chancellor, New Rights and New Laws were created, which taken 
together, came to be known as the Common Law, as opposed to the Customary Law enforced in the Local 
Courts, and which emerged during the latter part of the Thirteenth Century as a distinct System of National Law. 
The System, as thus developed, was the joint product of the Common-Law Courts. But it should be remembered that 
these Courts were powerless to act without the authority of the King’s Writs, and that this New System was faced 
with a Struggle for Jurisdiction and Power stretching over several hundred years against powerful rivals, chief 
among which were the Chancery and Ecclesiastical Courts, before it could achieve the position of first rank in 
the 
Sec. 8 

ORIGIN OF FORMS OF ACTION 
41 
field of Anglo-American law. The credit for the creation of a Centralized Judicial System belongs therefore 
not only to the Common-Law Courts, but to the King and the Royal Officials, who made effective the 
Judgments of the Royal Judges, and who, by the King’s Writs, made Remedies available which were not 
ordinarily available under the Customary Law of the land. The Original Writ System was the fundamental basis 
of the New System of Centralized Justice. 


Toward the Middle of the Thirteenth Century, the second great treatise in English law, Bracton’s De 

Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae, described by Pollock and Maitland as “the Crown and flower of English 
Medieval Jurisprudence,” 29 appeared. It served as a summary of the Writ System as it stood between 1250 and 
1258 and assured that the story of the development would be passed on to subsequent generations. Bracton took as 
his Model the Treatise of Mo of Bologna, the Great Civilian.” Maitland and Montague, in speaking of Bracton’s 
debt to Azo, said: 
“Thence he had obtained his idea of what a Law Book should be, and of how Law should be arranged and stated; 
thence also he borrowed Maxims and some Concrete Rules; with these he could fill up the Gaps in our English 
System,” 22 The core of this Treatise, however, was distinctly English and not Roman, and represented the Law as 
laid down by the Judgments of the King’s courts. If Bracton’s book be compared with that of Glanvilli, it will be 
seen that the Period be- 


so. 1 Polloclc and 3faitland, History of Engush Law, e. VI, The Age of Bracton, 185 (cambridge i595).

Procedural and Substantive Law, largely as a direct result of New Original Writs formulated in Chancery and 
approved by the “virile and progressive Judges who then manned the King’s Court.” ~ 


The Golden Age of the Forms of Action occurred during the last years of the Reign of Henry II [1216—12723, 
when the Old Ancient Real Common-Law Forms of Action were still in the running, while at the same time 
certain of the Modern Personal Actions had put in an appearance. It was during this Period, therefore, that the 
number of living Forms of Action reached its maximum. Shortly thereafter, the Real Actions revealed a 
tendency toward obsolescence, while the Common-Law power to create New Forms of Action was nearing its 
close. Under the influence of the Provisions of Oxford in 1258 only slight power of varying the Writs, Ancient or 
Modern, was left in the Chancellor; beyond this, relief lay by way of Parliament and Statute, and with the death of 
Edward I [1307], the first great Epoch of English Legislation ended. Thereafter, the greatest development of the 
Forms of Action was to be found in the development of the Common Law Actions of Case, Ejectment, Trover, 
Special and General Assumpsit—a distinguished array—which ousted many of the 
Older Actions and made heavy contributions to both Contract, Property and Tort Law. From one point of 
view this may be regarded as evidence of the vigor of the Forms of Action and as evidence of their capacity to 
forward the Development of Substantive Law; but from another viewpoint, it may be regarded as the 
“decline and fall of the Formulary System, for Writs are being made to do work for which they were

§ 54, 162 (St. Paul 1929).

not originally intended, and that work they can only do by means of Fiction.” 24 


The great expansion of the Royal Authority by use of the Writ System, as thus recorded by Bracton, did not 
depend entirely upon the work of the Common-Law Courts. Thus, out of the Residuary Power which remained in 
the King’s Council after the Common-Law Courts were differentiated therefrom, the Court of Chancery 
was created. The Ecclesiastical Courts, which assumed a separate existence after the Ordinance of 
LWI1UI- the Conqueror in 1072, governed matters of spiritual conduct, and certain aspects of the Law of 
Succession while much litigation was cared for in the Local Courts and in the Private Baronial Courts. Fewer 
Courts, less Jurisdictions, would appear to have been the demand of the day. Nevertheless, the Development of the 
Court of Chancery steadily proceeded. Why? 25 


fl. 2 Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, Bk. II, c. IX, Procedure, 562 (Cambridge 1895). 
‘The typical pitfall which a Pleader might meet with in selecting a Form of Action is well illustrated by 
one of David Dudley Field’s reminiscences concerning the period immediately preceding the Enactment of the New York Code 

of Procedure of 1848, when he said: “I came near losing a ease on a Policy of Insurance by declaring in Assurnpsft. When the Policy was 
produced at the Trial, the defendflat’s Counsel insisted that it had a Zeal and so the Action should have been Covenant. There was, in- 
deed, a mark on the paper as if it had been stamped with a Seal or something like it, but the impression was faint, and the Judge, 
?oolthtg at U without his glasses, said he could see no seal, and denied the Motion for Nonsuit.” Field, Law Reform in the United 
States and Its Influence Abroad, 25 Am.L. Rev. 515, 518 (1891). 


t5. With reference to the Development of Equity as an incident of the reluctance of the Clerks in Chancery to grant New Writs, Blackstone, 
in speaking of Chapter 24 of the Statute of Westminster II, 13 Edw. I (1285), which authorized the Clerks to Issue New Writs In Cases similar 
to but not quite Identical with Cases in which Writs were previously Issued, stated: “Which provision (with a little accuracy in the Clerks of 


the Chancery, and a little liberality In the Judges, by extending rather than narrowing the remedial effects of the Writ) might bave 
effectually answered all the purposes of a 
The answer seems to be connected with the Power of the Chancellor to issue Original Writs. As long as 
this power was unrestricted and broad enough to encompass what we now describe as Equitable Relief, there was 
little reason for the development of the Equity Courts. But this condition was not destined to continue. 


Among the Third Class of Writs set forth by Bigelow, there were a number which never became Writs of Course 
and which were of a character which in Modern Times would be regarded as Equitable. According to Big- 
elow,” these were Writs of Protection, being the forerunners of our Modern Writs of Injunction, and of the 
protective process generally as exercised by Chancery in its Early Stages of Development. The fact that these 
Writs never became dc oursu, accounts in no small measure, for the development of Exclusive Jurisdiction Over 


Page 54 of 735 


such Forms of Remedial Relief by Chancery. If these Writs had achieved the status of Writs of Course, they would 
have fallen outside the purview of the Provisions of Oxford in 1258, and hence the Jurisdiction of the Royal courts 
would have remained unlimited and unimpaired as to this Type of Writ. The result might well have been to 
eliminate Equity or at least to prevent the vast expansion which thereafter took place. Or to put it in another 
way, the result of this development was to deprive the Common-Law courts of the 

power to compel obedience to their Specific Orders, that is, of coercing obedience by orders in personam—a 
power, which we now know, as a result of research that has been done in the early cases, was exercised by the 
Superior Courts of the Norman Period. When the practice of issuing New Writs thus came to an end, the

Law was necessarily retarded at a time when it had not yet fully flowered, at a time when it had not fully emerged 
from its Primitive Stage, and its great qualities appeared as such only when viewed against the background of the 
earlier and existing situations, and not in the light of later developments. This untimely restriction upon the Power to 
Issue New Writs under which the Common Law had gone far in the direction of furnishing England a Complete and 
Adequate System of National Law, resulted in the Common Law falling short of its full fruition. Several reasons 
for this unfortunate development may retrospectively be assigned; they are: 


(A) Impairment of the Lards! Jurisdiction Over Their Private Courts—One of the Methods by which the 
Crown drew unto itself control over the Administration of Justice was by depriving the Barons of their 
Jurisdiction over disputes with their tenants. The theory was that the King intervened to assist a helpless tenant, 
or other litigant, as against a powerful landlord, but the net result was to give the King’s Court Jurisdiction 
over the case. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that when the Barons revolted against King John in 1215, they 
“exacted from him the first important concessions as the beginning of a long period of resistance to the absolute and 
centralized power of the English Kings.” 27 And they took advantage of the situation to make official their 
resentment of the encroachment upon their Baronial Jurisdiction by placing a provision in Magna Carta, Section 34 
of which declared: “The Writ which is called Praecipe for the future shall not be made out to anyone of any 
tenement whereby a freeman may lose his Court.” Such provision clearly indicates the opposition of the Bar- 
ons to the constant and increasing infringement upon their Jurisdiction, although it re 

mains doubtful whether it had any permanent effect in restricting the Chancery from issuing Writs, or the- King 
from continuing to impair the Jurisdiction of the Local as well as the Private Courts. 


(B) The Provisions of Oxford (1258).— The issue involving the impairment of the Jurisdictions of the 
Barons was again raised in 1258 at Oxford. At this time and place the power of devising New Writs and thereby 
creating New Rights of Action—a powerful and dangerous weapon in unscrupulou- hands—received a severe 
check. The Barons, headed by Simon de Montfort, forced upon Henry III [1216—1272] the Provisions of Oxford, 
under which an Oath was imposed upon the Chancellor that he would issue no Writs “excepting Writs of Course 
without the Commandment of the King and of his Council who shall be present.” ~ This provision, more 
effective than Section 34 of Magna Carta in 1215, placed in Parliament and not the King, the broad authority to cre- 
ate New Rights by granting New Remedies, with only a fraction of his former power left to the King. But, the effect 
of the Provisions was practically annulled some five years later by the decision of Louis IX, who was appointed as 
an arbitrator between Henry and the Barons, though the former power of the Chancellor does not seem to have 
been renewed. And, as so often happened in English History, Parliament made but scant use of this New Power. In 
conse— quence, the Provisions of Oxford soon became inoperative under the changing political conditions, so that 
to all practical intents and purposes, the right to Legal Relief was

—By this time, however, the Ancient Real Actions and certain of the later Common-Law Actions, such as 
Trespass, Debt, Detinue and Replevin, appear to have developed as a result of the action and interaction 
which took place over a long period of time between the Clerks in Chancery and the Common-Law Courts and 
Judges, without the aid of statutory enactments. 


While these Actions met the needs of their day fairly well, and through them, litigants were able to secure a rough 
and ready sort of Justice, they, nevertheless, fell far short of the Common Law ideal of providing a Remedy for 
every wrong. This was due in part to Defects in the Procedural Law and in part to Defects in the Substantive 
Law. On the Procedural Side, the Action of Detinue had been rendered practically useless because subject to Wager 
of Law—a handicap from which it never fully recovered, even after Wager of Law was abolished; and the Action 
of Debt was subject, in addition to Wager of Law, to the requirement of extreme particularity in setting out 
the various items of the demand sued on. On the Substantive Law Side, there were also wide Gaps in the Remedial 
Law in both the Contract and Tort Field. In the Contract Field, Covenant was still the only form of 
Contract known, unless a situation out of which a Common-Law duty to pay a debt could be regarded as Con- 
tractual, and No Remedy had been developed br the Breach of a Parol Promise. In the Tort Field, while Trespass 
served as a fairly Adequate Remedy where the injury complained of was accompanied by force, it took no 
cognizance of those injuries which were (1) nnaccompanied by force, such as in the mere detention of goods where 
there had been no unlawful taking; (2) accompanied 
by force, consequential and not immediate in its nature, such as an injury resulting from falling over a log, placed 


in the road at a time prior to the injury; (3) accompanied by force, and resulting in injury to property not then in 
possession of the owner, such as an injury to a reversionary interest in realty. These Defects, which we are now able 


to point out retrospectively, were not definitely recognized at that time. 


At this point, however, It should be reniernijered that the Writ of Trespass on the Case, which authorized 
the plaintiff to bring an action on the Particular Facts of his own case, in situations where none of the 
approved Writs in the Register fit, had already been recognized.” But before it had developed into a well- 
recognized and fully approved Writ, the power of devising New Writs and thereby creating New Rights of 
Action received a severe check by the Provisions of Oxford. 


Nevertheless, the presence of the Defects outlined above, coupled with the commercial growth and development 
of the country, were, perhaps, an unconscious factor which led to the enactment in 1285 of the Statute of 
Westminster 11,~° which authorized the Clerks in Chancery to issue New Writs in all cases similar to but not quite 
identical with cases in which Writs had been previously issued, thus giving rise to the question

as to whether the Action of Trespass on the Case originated out of the Statute, or is to be more satisfactorily 
explained on some other theory. The issue thus presented has long been the subject of a learned controversy which 
has developed a considerable literature. The participants in this controversy, among whom are some of the most 
distinguished Anglo-American Legal Historians, Scholars and Teachers, have developed Three Schools of 
Thought. These include: 


(1) Those who believe that the Action of Trespass on the Case developed as a result of the impact of the Statute 
of Westminster II,~’ taking its very name from the word casu as used in the famous and familiar phrase 
“consimili casu,” which appeared in Chapter 24 of the Statute. This group, known as the “Modernists,” is 
represented by Ames,” Jenks -and Sutton.” 


(2) Those who think that the Statute of Westminster It - had nothing to do with the Origin of the Action on the 
Case. This group, known as the “Revolutionists,” includes Plucknett`* and Dix.*! 


21. 13 Edw. I, c. 24, 1 Pickering’s Statutes at Large

modern sense, but 
rather as a series of Statutes enacted at one session of Parliament. Pifoot, History and Sources

(3) Those who adopt the Middle View that while the Action on the Case existed prior to 1285, the date on 
which the Statute was enacted, its development into the Modem Action of Trespass on the Case would not have 
occurred without the influence and action on the part of the Clerks in Chancery as authorized by Parliament in 
Chapter 24 of the Statute of Westminster II ~ in 1285. This group, known as the “Traditionalists,” includes 
Holdsworth®? and Landon‘? 


(0) The Growing intervention of Ultancery.—Perhaps the real responsibility for the Arrested Development 
of the Common Law should be laid at the door of Chancery. Clearly the Inventive genius of the Clerks in Chancery 
had not come to an end as in that event there would have been no need f or Section 34 of Magna Carta in 1215 or 
the Provisions of Oxford in 1258. As a matter of policy the King’s Council evidently felt that there were certain 
Areas of Jurisdiction over which it desired to retain a closer supervision, and the argument seized upon for 
such a course of action was that there were certain defects in the Common-Law Remedial Scheme, as a result 
of which Meritorious Litigants were left Without Remedy at Law, hence the intervention of Chancery became 
necessary. But such was not always the case, as where the captain of a ship came into an English port, and being 
there but a few days, demanded payment of a debt due from an Englishman. Thus, the King, desiring to advance 
the mercantile interests of the country, and in the face of the established fact that the plaintiff had an Adequate 
Remedy at Law in the Action of Debt, permitted the Chancellor to hail the defendant into Court,

examine him under Oath as to the debt, and if found to be owing, Order its payment on peril of being jailed for 
Contempt for failure to obey the Order.” Or the King may have intervened through the Chancellor, not be- 
cause there was no Common-Law Remedy, but because the State of Law and Order in the country was in such a 
condition that an Ordinary Litigant in a Contest with a Powerful Overlord, could not take advantage of his 
Common-Law Remedy.” Thus, the Common Law’s development was arrested when it was beginning to get a good 
start, and at a time when the social and economic needs of the country demanded expansion instead of 
restriction of the Common Law Remedial 
System. 


CLASSLFICATJON OF TILE COMMON-LAW ACTIONS 


9. Actions at Common Lav, are divided into 

Real, Mixed and Personal. Real Actions included those brought for the Specific Recovery of Lands, 
Tenements, or Hereditaments. Personal Actions consisted of those brought for the Specific Recovery 
of Goods and Chattels, or for Damages for Breach of Contract, or for Damages for some Injury to 
the Person, or to one’s Relative Rights, or to Personal or Real Property. Mixed Actions partook, in 
some degree, of both Real and Personal Actions, wherein some Real Property was awarded, and also Personal 
damages for a Wrong sustained, and hence they were not properly reducible to either of them. they were 
brought both for the 

Specific Recovery Of Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, and for Damages for injury sustained in respect of such property. 


ACCORDING to the Relief sought, Actions have been Divided into: 


(A) Real 
(B) Mixed, and 
(C) Personal 


41. Barbour, The History of Contract in Early English Equity, 4 Oxford Studies in social and Legal History, Pt. II, c. II, § 3, 98 (Edited by 
Vinogradoff, Oxford 1914). 


REAL ACTIONS.—Real Actions were those brought for the Specific Recovery of “Seisin,” the possession 
of a freehold estate in Real Property. They included: 


The Writs of Right 

The Possessory Assizes 

Writs of Entry 

Forcible Entry and Detainer 


MIXED ACTIONS.—Mixed Actions are such as are brought both for the Recovery of Real Property, and for 
Damages for injury in respect to it. Waste was an example of this Type of Action and it lay to recover 
land wasted by a tenant with Treble Damages, 


PERSONAL ACTION,S.—Personal Actions are those brought for the Recovery of a Debt or Possession of 


Specific Personal Property, or of Damages for the Breach of a Contract, or of Damages for some Injury to 
the Person, or to one’s Relative Rights, or to Personal or Real Property. 


Page 58 of 735 


The remedy which a given Writ afforded a Litigant was called an Action. And as these Actions grew in 
number and scope, as a result of the action and interaction which took place between the Chancery and the Three 
Superior Common-Law Courts, they were 
often differentiated by very slight shadings of meanings, and it was only natural that an effort should be made 
to classify the various Actions. And in connection with this effort, it should always be borne in mind that 
the term “classification” may and almost inevitably is bound to have different implications in Different 
Periods of a Nation’s Development. Thus, if, in English Legal History, we go back as far as Glanvill and 
Bracton, we find that they regarded some Actions Personal which Blackstone,” writing about 1765, treated as 
Real or Mixed. But for general purposes, we may nevertheless now use as

our starting point the Classification which Blackstone published to the world with the appearance of the first 
edition of his Commentaries on the Laws of England. He declared: “With us in England the several Suits or 
Remedial Instruments of Justice, are from the subject of them distinguished into three kinds, Real, Mixed and 
Personal.” 

“Real Actions (or as they are called in the Mirror, Feudal Actions), which concern Real Property only, are 
such whereby the plaintiff, here called the Demandant, claims title to have any lands or tenements, rents, com- 
mons, or other hereditaments, in fee-simple, fee-tail, or for term of life. By these Actions formerly all disputes 
concerning Real Estates were decided; but they are now pretty generally laid aside in practice, on account of the 
great nicety required in their management, and the inconvenient length of their process; a much more expeditious 
method of trying titles being since introduced, by other Actions Personal and Mixed. 

“Mixed Actions are suits partaking of the nature of the other two, wherein some real property is demanded, and 
also personal damages for a wrong sustained. As for instance an Action of Waste. 


“Personal Actions are such whereby a man claims a Debt, or Personal Duty, or Damages in lieu thereof; and, 
likewise, whereby a man claims a satisfaction in Damages for some injury done to his person or property. The 
former are said to be founded on Contracts, the latter upon Torts or Wrongs; and they are the same which the Civil 
Law calls ‘actiones in personam, quae adversus eum intenduntur, qui ox contractu vel delicto obligatus ost 
aliquid dare vol concedere’. Of the former nature are all actions upon Debt or Promises; of the latter all 
actions for Trespasses, Nuisances, Assaults, Defamatory Words, and the like. 


44. The original arrangement of the three types of Actions reads Personal, Mixed and Real, which or~ der has been changed for purposes of 
presenta 


“Under these three heads may every species of remedy by Suit or Action in the Courts of Common Law be 
comprised.” ~ 


TILE ANCIENT REAL ACTIONS FIRST IN ORDER OF DEVELOPMENT 
10. There were Two Divisions of the Real Actions—those founded on Seizin or Possession, and those 
founded on the Property or Right. 


JACKSON defines a Real Action as “one that is brought to recover the freehold in lands, tenements or 


hereditaments, claimed either in fee simple, fee tail, or for life, by one who is deforced, against him who is a 
tenant thereof.” They were known as Real Actions because the Judgments rendered therein were in rem 


Page 59 of 735 


and awarded seizin or possession.” In these Actions the Party bringing the Action was known as the 
Demandant, while the Party against whom it was brought was the Tenant. And the First Pleading on the part of 
the Demandant was called a Count. Over a Period of Several Centuries running as far as the reign of Elizabeth 
[1558~1603],~~ the existence of these Remedies, available only in favor of owners of freehold estates, made 
possible the settlement of all disputes concerning real estate on a reasonably satisfactory basis. These Writs to 
determine the rights of property and the rights of possession in a freehold, varied according to the title or seizin of the 
Demandant, and the circumstances of ouster or deforcenient; they were feudal in origin and were in number about 
sixty, the distinction between them being highly technical and refined, and the trial long and costly, all of which 
facts were factors in their ultimate

property and the right of possession might be in different persons while the actual possession was in a third person, 
actual possession was regarded as a right distinct from the right of property and the right of possession.” 


If one having the Complete Title to land was dispossessed, he lost one of the constituent elements of his Title, 
that is, actual possession. This left remaining in him the right of possession and the right o~ property. As to all 
other persons except the person ousted, the disseisor became the owner of the Complete Title; as to the person 
ousted, he was the owner of the Complete Title, subject to be defeated by enforcement of the disseisee’s superior 
right of property or right of possession. If such rights were not enforced within certain periods of time fixed by the 
Common Law or by Statute, the disseisor’s Title became indefeasible as to all failing to show a superior right of 
property or right of pos 


50. “The treatment of Actual Possession as a Right, or as implying a right distinct from the right of possession, has been misleading. 
Actual possession is a Fact or Status. As a Fact it Is prima Jane Evidence of the Right of possession, because It is the natural 
manifestation of that right As a Fact or Status it is protected by Law for reasons of public policy against displacement, except by 
Judicial Process at the instance of someone having a Superior Right to possess. Peaceable Possession therefore is not a Right, but 
it is a Fact or Status which implies the Right in the possessor to continue his possession until it is displaced by Judicial Process. 
This Right of Possession is provisional, and subject to determination at the suit of any one having an older and therefore Superior Right 
of Posses-zion. In imputing to the peaceable possessor a Right in the Fact of his Possession, nothing more could have been Intended than to 
recognize In him a Peculiar Right of Possession, which springs from and is implied from the Present Pact of Possession. This Eight of 
Possession night co-exist with a Right of Possession In some one else springing from a Previous Fact or Status of peaceable possession. Thus 
we have two persons Invested with rights of possession. One founds his right on a present peace~ able possession, the other founds it on a 
previous peaceable possession, or a Right of property which resolves itself ultimately Into an older possession or seisin.” Martin, Civil 
Procedure at Common Law, c. IV, Ancient Real Actlons, 100, n. 1 (St. Paul, 1905). 


session. The same rule applied in case of an abatement where upon the death of a person seized of an 
inheritance a stranger acquired possession of the freehold before actual entry of the heir or devisee; also in case 
of an intrusion where a stranger, after termination of a particular estate of freehold, acquired possession before 
entry of the remainclerman or reversioner. The effect of a disscisin, abatement or intrusion was to convert the 
estate of the disseisee, heir, dew isee, remainderman, or reversioner, as the case might be, into rights of possession 
and rights of property. Such rights were descendible, but neither devisable nor assignable. Conversely, the interest 
of the disseisor, abator, or intruder, was alienable, divisible and descendible, being an estate in possession. 


These rights of property and rights of possession were remediable under the Ancient Law by the Extra-Judicial 
Process of Self-Help, or by the Judicial Process represented in the Scheme of Real Actions. Upon disseisin, 
abatement or intrusion, the person ousted—the disseisee, heir, devisee, remainderman, or reversioner—was 
permitted to make a peaceable entry, making his Title again complete. If peaceable entry was not possible, his only 
course was to resort to legal redress, as force could not be used without falling under penal restrictions. Entry by 
force was not only a punishable offense, but the former occupant could by a Writ of Forcible Entry immediately be 
restored to possession, irrespective of any right of possession or right of property of the original disseisee. Failure 


Page 61 of 735 


on the part of the disseisee to make a peaceable entry in the lifetime of the disseissor, abator or intruder, resulted 
in ending the right of peaceable entry without process. Extra-Judicial Entry was ended by the fact of a descent cast. 
Thereafter the disseissor’s heir could rot be ousted except by an Action asserting the disseisee’s superior right 
of possession or of 


SO

property. But the descent of incorporeal hereditaments lying in grant did not take away the right of entry.” The 
disseisee, however, by making claim at any time before the death of the disseisor, might evade the effect 
of the descent east, and save his right of entry for a year and a day after such claim made. Thus, the 
continuance of the disseisor in possession after claim made was regarded as a new disseisin. By the 
Statute of 32 Henry VIII, c. 33, 5 Statutes at Large 48, -1540], the Right of Entry was extended so that a 
descent from a disseisor could not have the effect of taking away the Right of Entry, except where the 
disseisor had peaceable possession five years next after the disseisin, The Statute was construed as not 
being applicable to a descent from the heir of a disseisor, or from his feoffee, so that such descents barred 
the Right of Extra-Judicial Entry, notwithstanding a want of five years’ possession. It may be added that 
in cases in which the wrongdoer had acquired possession lawfully and then unlawfully detained it, the 
party entitled had neither a Possessory Action, nor Remedy by Self-Help; he could only invoke a 
Proprietary Action to establish his rights. 


For reasons of public policy, the Common Law protected a person in peaceable possession of land, 
irrespective of the method of acquisition.” Actual seisin or possession, however acquired and however wrongful, 
created a presumptive right of possession, or a species of property based on the fact of 


51. Co.Litt. 28Th (London, 179t). 


55. “It accomplished this In three ways: Zst, by refusing to enforce in the Courts any one’s Claim to Possession wbicb was not Superior to 
the flight of the actual possessor; 24, by summarily restoring to the ousted possessor his possession, when it was 
forcibly taken from him, Irrespective of any Right of Possession, in the party who had interrupted the possession; 3d, by punishing any one 
who attempted to enforce his Rights of Possession, without Process of the Courta’ Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. IV,

his possession~ In case of being dispossessed, the disseisee could vindicate his right of possession by resort to 
some Possessory Proceeding, basing his action on his actual seisin and the wrongful act of the disseisor in 
ousting him. At hand were the Possessory Remedies in the Form of the various Writs of Assize or a Writ of 
Entry, depending upon the character of his case. Also available was Self-Help if resorted to before descent cast, 
and if not barred by the Common Law or Statute. If such Remedy failed or was lost, he still might regain 
possession by some form of Possessory Action, provided he acted within the period of time in force at the time the 
action was brought. In general, limitation of Possessory Actions was fixed at twenty years. If the Possessory 
Action was not brought within the time limit, or if, when brought, it resulted in defeat, the disscisee night still 
resort to a Proprietary Action, if brought within the period of time limiting such actions, which was sixty 
years. In such actions the plaintiff alleged seisin or possession of a fee, and added that he claimed “as of 
right,” thus raising the Issue of ultimate dominion, or right of ownership, which either included or implied the 
superior right of possession as incident to it or constituted the right itself. Generally, this dominion or ownership 
is referred to as something very different in its nature from the right of possession. It becomes apparent, 
however, when ownership in land is resolved into its essential elements, that the fundamental one is the right of 
possession. It would seem, therefore, that the right of property enforced in the Proprietary Actions is nothing more 
than an older and superior right of possession.” 


In its strictest sense property is the right to possess and use a determinate thing, in~3. Ibid.

definitely in point of user, unlimitedly in point .of duration, and unrestricted in point of alienation or 
disposition.” In England there was probably no property in land which measured up to this ideal of absolute 
property. But from Bracton on, the rights of proprietorship have been ascribed to the tenant in demesne, 
notwithstanding the rights of seigniory remaining in the lord and ultimately in the sovereign. The right of 
the tenant in fee has in point of fact been treated as property in the highest sense, even though it falls short of the 
ideal of absolute property. And the philosophy or logic of property rights has been done no violence by ascribing 
them without limitation to the rights of a tenant in English law, much less to a purchaser in fee under the Laws 
of the Several States of the United States. 


As the foundation of the right of ownership is the right of possession to which the other rights are primarily 
incidental, it follows that one cannot use or dispose of a thing which is in the adverse possession of another. 
When the right to possession is once vindicated, these other rights are restored along with the possession. Williams, 
the distinguished authority on English Property Law, has stated that there is “no action in the Law of 
England by which property either in goods or land is alone decided,” ~ as distinguished from the right to 
possession either immediate or future. The explanation of this is found in the fact that the right of property in land 
or goods is only another name for the right of possession, and the other rights incidental to it. Thus, in all of the 
Real Actions, whether Proprietary or Possessory, the Material Issue was the right of possession. As Pollock and 
Maitland so 


5~. 2 Blackstone’s commentaries on the Laws of England, c. I, 207—215 {4th ed. by Chase, New York 
1914). 

truly observed, “every Title to Land has its root in Seisin; the Title which has its root in the Oldest Seisin is 
the Best Title.” ~ The superior right of possession, being the older one, was called the right of property, 
but only in comparing it with the right of possession, which came from subsequent adverse enjoyment, and which 
was to be protected by Law for reasons of public policy. If the technical distinction between Proprietary and 
Possessory actions had never developed, and if our English ancestors had only known Possessory Actions, it is 
extremely probable that the Scheme of Ancient Real Actions would have been better understood and enforced. We 
shall see later how this failure was instrumental in bringing about the abolltion of the Real Actions.

Forcible Entry and Detainer 


AT Common Law the Remedy for a Forcible Entry or a Forcible Detainer was not recognized as a Civil 
Action. When authorized by Statute,” it originated as an incident 


53. See Statute of 5 RIch. IT, c. 7, 2 Statutes at Large 
240 (1381). 


to a criminal prosecution of a Party who had used superior force in making entry upon land.” The Remedy 
as thus developed took the form of a summary restitution of the land in question by the Justices of the » or by 


Action Of the Court of King’s Bench. This proceeding, under which the disseisee might be restored to his Jand, was 


early used as a substitute for the more cumbersome and highly technical Real Actions, thus aiding in their gradual 
deterioration.” 


According to Blackstone 62a Forcible En-try consisted of violently taking possession of lands or tenements 
with force and arms and without authority of Law. And a Forcible Detainer consisted of keeping possession of 
lands and tenements in the same lawless manner. Both offenses were not only against the person turned out 
or kept out of possession, but were wrongs against the King. 


As enacted and construed these English Statutes on Forcible Entry and Detainer furnished a Popular Remedy for 
a period of five hundred years. In 1879, the Statute of 8 Hen. VT, c. 9, 3 Statutes at Large 121 (1429) was repealed 
except as to its criminal provisions.® And the Ancient English statutes regulating Forcible Entries and Detainers, 
in large measure, have been recognized or reenacted in most American States, with such modifications as might be 
necessary to meet local conditions, and as such have exerted an important influence on our Modern 
Procedure.

MODERN REAL ACTIONS 
53 

The Decline of the Real and Mixed Actions 

BY reason of the large number of Writs in the Real Actions, by reason of the long, dilatory and highly technicai 
character of the proceedings thereunder, together with the burdensome cost incidental to their prosecution; 
and finally, by reason of the almost imperceptible distinctions between many of them, with the passage of time, 
their Inadequacy as Remedies for the redress of alleged wrongs involving Title or Possession of Real 
Estate became evident. The Defects in the Proceedings involved in the various Real Actions and the 
abuses which grew up around them had originated in the Courts and for years had gone on uninterrupted by any 
attempt at Parliamentary Reform. 


In the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, as an incident of the general wave of Governmental Reform 
which swept over England, a Movement for Procedural Law Reform got under way. It is therefore not surprising to 
find that in 1833, by the Real Property Limitations Act,” the Real and Mixed Actions, with few exceptions, were 
swept aside. The Statute provided that some sixty actions, specifically named,® should not be brought after 
December 31, 1834. 


64. 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 27, § 36 (1833). 


65. The Statute of 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 27, § 36 provides that: 'No writ of right patent, writ of right quja dominus remisit curiam, wi-it of right in 
capite, writ of right In London, writ of right close, writ of right do rationabit parte, writ of right of advowson, writ Of right upon disclaimer,

Exceptions were made Writ of Right of Dower, er undo nihil h-abet, and 
Impedit, the latter being preserved to try disputes about Advowsons, as Ejectment, which now came to be used in 
lieu of the abolished Real Actions, was inapplicable for such purposes. As a widow claiming dower could not 
institute an Action of Ejectment until after her dower had been set out,°° the two Writs of Dower were temporarily 
preserved. In 1860, with the establishment of a New Statutory Form of Action to serve as a substitute, the Old Writs 
of Dower were abolished by the Common Law Procedure Act.*” Also abolished by the same 
act was the Writ of Quczre Impedit. 

TUE MODERN REAL ACTIONS 

11. The Modern Real Actions included 
Ejectment, Trespass to Try Title, Writs of 
Entry, Disseisin, Dower and Partition, and 
Forcible Entry and Detainer. 


The Action of Ejectment 

WHEN it finally became clear that the so-called distinction between the Proprietary and Possessory 
Actions was largely illusory, that you could not Try Title without also trying possession, and that these Actions 
were needlessly technical and very expensive,

Ch. 2 
the slate was cleared for the entry of a far simpler, yet more Adequate Remedy for the redress of Wrongs to 
Title or Possession— the Action of Ejectment. This move by the Common-Law Courts was hastened by the 
threatened intervention of Chancery. And the change came about not by developing a New Remedy, but “by 
adapting the well known Process and Proceedings of Personal Actions to the Trial of Issues relating to ouster and 
disseisin from real estate.” °~ More specifically, the Action of Ejectment was developed out of the Writs of Quare 
Ejecit In Ira Terininum and Dc Ejectione Firmae in favor of the owners of non-freehold estates. Through the use 
of the famous Fiction in Ejectment it ultimately became available to the holders of freehold estates as well, without 
violating the Common-Law theory that it could be used only to protect the possession of non-freehold estates. 
The details of this development will be set forth fully in the Chapter on the Action of Ejectment.°° 


The Action, as thus developed by the Common Law, was excepted from the sweeping effect of the Statute of 3 & 
4 Wm. TV, c. 
27, § 36,73 Statutes at Large 149 (1833), and continued unchanged until 1852. Under the Common-Law Procedure 
Acts of 1852,~° 1854 ~: and 1860 72 the Procedure in the Action was simplified, the Fiction in Ejectment was 
abolished, so that the Action was directed to the person actually in possession of the property in dispute, or 
to any other person entitled to defend the Action, and it was provided that in the Default of Appearance such 
person would be dispossessed. If the

defendant 4ppeared, the Court made up an Issue, and the Case was tried according to the Principles of 
Ejectment as developed at Common Law. And so the Action continued until the Supreme Court of Judicature 
Act of 1873,~~ under which the Action was “commenced by a Judicial Writ of Summons upon which the 
plaintiff indorses a Statement of his Claim with the Relief asked for, to which the defendant makes a Statement of 
his Defense. The Pleadings are governed by Rules of Court under General Orders made in 1883,”” Although the 
Remedy under this Act has lost its Earlier Form, it is still governed by the principles underlying the Action as 
Developed at Common Law. And this same Common-Law Action has been generally adopted, subject to 
modification in its Form and Procedure, as the generally recognized mode of Trying Title or possession in the 
Several States of the United States. 


The Action of Trespass to Try Title 

THE Action of Trespass to Try Title has been used in three states, Alabama, South Carolina and Texas. 

Derived from the Action of Trespass Quai-e Clausem Fregit, it was first introduced by Statute in South 
Carolina in 1791,~~ being substituted in the place of Ejectment. Mere possession was sufficient to support the 


Action as against a wrong-doer, but it was not sufficient as against one with a Superior Title. And, as in Trespass, 
the defendant might enter a Plea of liberuni tenementwnt, that is, that the land he entered upon was owned by 


Page 66 of 735 


himself, or by some one under whose authority he acted, the defendant claimed that he had an immediate Right 
of Entry. Thus the Right of Entry came to be the Controlling Issue in the Action of Trespass, but recovery 
resulted only ina

Judgment for Damages. This use of Trespass to Try Title was brought about by indorsing on the Writ of the Action 
for Trespass a notice that the Action was brought to Try Title, as well as for Damages. And if the entry had ousted 
the plaintiff, the plaintiff if successful, was entitled to a Writ of ilabere Facias Possessionem and Damages 
Abolished in South Carolina in 1873,~~ it appeared in Alabama in 1821,” where it continued to 1852, ~ at which 
time it was superseded by an Action in the Nature of an Action of Ejectment. 


In Texas, Trespass to Try Title was long the accepted and exclusive Mode for Trial of disputed Titles. As 
developed there it was broader than Ejectment, being maintainable even on an Equitable Title, and available to Try 
Title irrespective of occupancy. In general, the Trial was governed by the principles of Trial by Ejectment, except 
where the Statute provided otherwise.” 


Writs of Entry 
IN a modified Form, the Possessory Writ under this name, was adopted in Maine, Massachusetts and New 
Hampshire.*° In the two latter States at least a life estate was necessary to support the action.” Generally, the 
Action was directed against the actual tenant of the land, but if the defendant ousted the demandant, the latter might 
treat the defendant as a disseisor, in order to try the right, although claiming an estate of less than a freehold.”

simplified over those which prevailed in England prior to the Era of Reform. 


Writ of Dissejsin 

THE Writ of Disseisin long served in Connecticut as a substitute for the Common-Law Actions of the Writ 
of Right, the Writ of Entry and the Writ of Ejectment.** It was commenced and prosecuted like a Personal Action, 
and was available onl~’ on the basis of a Legal Title. According to Martin, it resembled Ejectment closely and was 
frequently called by that name.* But in 1888, the Action was superseded by a Statutory Form of Procedure.*° 


Dower 
UNDER the Statute of 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 27, § 36, 73 Statutes at Large 149 (1833), a Dower was one of the 


Page 67 of 735 


Actions excepted from abolition. But resort to the Action became constantly less frequent because Chancery had 
long since intervened to exercise Concurrent Jurisdiction with the Law Court in protecting dower rights.*’ And the 
flexibility of the Procedure in Equity gave it an increasing preference over the Remedy at Law. While in general the 
right to dower is governed by Statute which has superseded the Common Law, in the enforcement of such Statute, 
resort may still be had to Common Law and Equity for Remedial Relief, where, for any reason, the Statutes fail to 
cover the Point in Issue. In many States a Bill in Equity is had for Dower under which dower is admeasured, 
Damages are Assessed

12. From the close of the Reign of Queen

suffered a decline with the consequence that 
the Modern Personal Actions emerged as a

But from the close of 


Elizabeth’s Reign [1603] the Ancient Real Actions 
fell into a decline, with the Modem 


Common-Law Actions emerging as the principal 
System of Actions. These Personal

MODERN PERSONAL ACTIONS 
57 

Personal Actions, as indicated in the Chart above, include Actions that are brought for the Recovery of a Debt, or 
for Damages for the Breach of a Contract, or for Tort, for some Injury to the Person, or to Relative Rights or to 
Personal or Real Property. The most common of these Actions are Debt, Covenant, Assumpsit, Detinue, Trespass, 
Trespass on the Case, Trover and Replevin. 


Personal Actions are divided, according to their nature, into Actions Ex Contractu and Actions E’x Delicto. 
The former are Actions based upon a Contract, Express or Implied; while the latter are for injuries, the right to 
recover for which is not based upon Contract, but upon Tort. This attempt to distribute our Personal Forms under the 
two heads of Contract and Tort, as Maitland points out, has never been very successful or very important.°° 


Of the Forms of Action which have been enumerated above, the Action of Ejectment has been classified as a Real 
Action, as well as a Personal Action, as is indicated in the preceding section. In the classification of actions as 
Ex Contractu and Ex Delicto, some writers put Detinue on one side of the line and some on the other. 


The above Classification of all Personal Actions as Ex Contractu or Ex Delicto cannot be supported on 
principle, for there are many duties imposed by Law, a Breach of which constitutes neither a Tort nor the violation 
of a Genuine Contract, as, for instance, the failure to pay a Debt imposed by Custom, Judgment or Statute. In some 
of these cases the Classification has been maintained by 


93.Ma~tJan~l, Equity and the Forms of Action at Common Law 369 (Cambridge 1910); Pollock, Torts, Appendix A, 571 (11th ed. London 
1920). 

Actions at Law or in Equity may be classified, according to the nature of the Cause of Action, as (1) 
Actions of Tort; (2) Actions of Contract; (3) Actions on Non-Contractual Obligations; (4) Proprietary Actions; (5) Actions of Status; and

& Chicago 1911). 
treating the Action as if arising on Contract, although clearly not so arising. In others, the duty imposed by Law 
so resembles the duty assumed by Contract that they have for convenience been included in Actions Ex 
Contractu. 


The Decline of the Modern Personal Actions 


THE Personal Actions, which, in general were of later development than the Real Actions,—developed out 
of the Action and Interaction which, over a Period of Several Centuries, took place between the Chancery and the 
Three Royal Superior Courts without the aid of any Legislative Enactment, and included the Actions of Debt, 
Covenant, Account, Detinue, Replevin, Trespass and Ejection; also Trespass on the Case, Trover, Special 
Assumpsit and General Assumpsit, the development of which, according to one view, was given considerable 
impetus, directly or mdirectly, by the power granted to the Chancery Clerks by the Statute of Westminister II (1285) 
~M while others have either minimized or discounted the effect of this Statute on this development. As the Old Real 
and Mixed Actions declined these Personal Common-Law Actions naturally came into wider use. Their Supremacy 
and the Procedures connected therewith long stood unchallenged. But in 1834, as an Incident of a demand for 
improvement in Legal Procedure, the Hilary Rules *- were promulgated. They were designed to limit the Scope of 
the Various General Issues in the Actions, and to restore the Ancient Strict Common-Law Theory that under a Plea

Issue a defendant was restricted in his Proof to offers of Evidence having a logical tendency to deny the Material 
Allegations in the Declaration, and he could not offer Evidence of Defenses going to dispute liability. But the 
effort did not stay the Movement for Reform. Under the Uniformity of Process Act,” enacted in 1832, the Process in 
the Personal Actions was made uniform. The Old Form of Writ was abolished in favor of a New, Statutory Form, 
which, as a parting tribute to the Old Form, was characterized by the requirement that the Pleadings should include 
by name one of the Recognized Forms of Actions. A second assault upon the Status of the Personal Actions came in 
1852 when the Common-Law Procedure Act” eliminated the requirements that the plaintiff should mention in any 
Summons any Form or Cause of Action. Even so the Personal Forms of Action as developed at Common Law 
remained substantially intact, 


It was thus left for the final blow to be delivered by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act of 1873,°~ and the 
Rules promulgated under its authority, which was extended in 1875?~ This Statute not only abolished the Common- 
Law Forms of Action; but, following the lead of the Code Reforms in the United States, undertook to wipe out the 
distinctions between Law and Equity, by establishing a Single Court with both Law and Equity Jurisdiction, so that 
the question in England ceased to be whether a plaintiff had a Cause of Action at Law or a Suit in Equity, and came 
to be one of whether he had a Cause of Action under the Law of England.’

TILE EFFECT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORMS OF ACTION 


13. The Development of the Forms of Action, both Ancient and Modern, resulted in the Creation of a 
Formulary System of Procedure, under which each Form of Action came to stand for a more or less Specific 
Theory of Liability. 


WITH a view of the Historical Development of the Common-Law Actions, Ancient and Modem in mind, it 
immediately becomes evident why any attempt to define what constitutes a “Form of Action,” in advance of such a 
survey, is practically meaningless. Thus, it now appears that the student, before attempting a definition, should 
realize that the Forms of Action were not created at one stroke out of pre-existing raw materials; that they grew over 
a period of Several Centuries; that there was more than One Set of Common-Law Actions—the Ancient Real 
and Mixed, and the Modem Parsonal Actions 
—the latter being almost completely substituted in lieu of the former after the Reformatory Legislation of 1833. It 
appears further that the student, as a condition precedent to an understanding of the Forms of Action, should first 
have some appreciation of the effect of the Norman Conquest in Centralizing Justice in the Crown; 
the~.organization and Development of the Superior-Common-Law Courts and their relation to the Local 
Courts and Franchises; the story of the Original Writ and its creation and effect; the dependence of Right 
upon Remedy; the connection between the Charge in the Original Writ and the Charge in the Declaration; the 
Power of Chancery to issue New Varieties of Original Writs; the effect of the Provisions of Oxford in 1258 in 
destroying Equitable Remedies based on earlier Common-Law Writs not of course, thus depriving the Common- 
Law Courts of the power to coerce obedience by orders in personam, and preparing the way for a vast 
expansion of Equity Jurisdiction; the various theories concern-

ing the effect of the Statute of Westminster II (1283) upon the Writ System; the Classification of the Ancient Real 
Actions as Proprietary and Possessory; the ascendency and decline of the Ancient Real Actions; the Development of 
the Modem Real Actions; and finally, the emergence of the Modern Personal Common-Law Actions. Against this 
background only is it practicable for the student to draw any clear-cut conclusions as to what constitutes a “Form of 
Action.” The first step in this direction ought to be that of drawing the student’s attention to the distinctions between 
a “Form of Action” and a “Cause of Action”. 


A Cause of Action and a Form of Action Distin gwished 


TO fully understand the Common-Law Forms of Action, the student must clearly distinguish between a 
Cause of Action and a Form of Action, At the very moment the first application was made to the Chancellor for the 
First Original Writ, it might be urged that there was no distinction, for until a sufficient number of Writs had been 
issued to develop a body of Substantive Law, no Cause of Action could exist except as an incident of the issuance of 
some Form of Writ. Once a given Writ had been used enough to find a secure place on the Register of Writs, 
it became one of a class known as the Writs of Course (brevja dc cursu), Such Writs were issued as of course to 
any applicant upon the payment of the appropriate fee. Writs which were issued upon application to the Chancellor, 
and which required an exercise of discretion, were known as Magisterial Writs (brevia magistralia) ~2 This latter 
type of Writ in the beginning was often varied to meet the varying circumstances of the Cases disclosed in the 
plaintiff's Petition for Relief. Bracton, in speaking of the early Common-Law Scheme of Remedial Action, 
observed, Tot erunt formulae brcvium quot 
stint genera actionum. There may be as many Forms of Action as there are Causes of Action. As he conceived 
the matter the Remedy (remedium) was in exact equilibrium with jus, or, as of then, where there was a Right of 
Action there was a Form of Action to vindicate an Alleged Wrong. Bracton’s view was justified, for as yet, Form 
was the servant and had not become the master; Form had only served as a procedural device for securing 
conciseness in the statement of the Grounds of Action. However this may be, the net result of the issuance of Writs 
of Course and Magisterial Writs was to develop a well-defined body of Substantive Law. 


Page 71 of 735 


And once such a body of Substantive Law had been developed, the distinction between a Cause of Action and a 
Form of Action became vitally important if the plaintiff was to be successful in the statement of his Cause of 
Action. Thus, conceivably, it might be possible for a plaintiff to select the correct Form of Action to fit the particular 
combination of facts or events presented in his Case and yet, by failure to include in his Declara. tion one of the 
Allegations required by the Substantive Law as essential to the statement of his Cause of Action, he might utterly 
fail in the enforcement of his right. To illustrate, if A ousted B from Blackacre, the proper Form of Action for B to 
institute would be Ejectment. Since, however, under the Substantive Law of Real Property B was required to aliege 
Title, Ouster and Damages in order to state a good Cause of Action in Ejectment, failure on B’s part to allege Title 
would result in a failure to state a good Cause of Action. And the fact that B has selected the Correct Form of 
Action—Ejectment—would not save his Cause. If, however, the plaintiff had stated all the Allegations required by 
the Substantive Law of Real Property as essential to the Statement of a Cause of Action in Ejectment, but had 


selected as his Form of Action Trespass to

Real Estate, he still would have met with defeat. The phrase “Cause of Action,” therefore, ilepends upon and is 
prescribed by the Substantive Law applicable to the Specific Facts of the Particular Case, whereas the phrase 
“Form of Action” goes to the Theory of Liability, that is, the plaintiff must state the Combination of Facts or 
Events on which he relies in such a manner as to invoke one of the categories of liability represented by what we 
cali a “Form of Action.” In other words it is descriptive of the technical Mode of Framing the Writ and Pleadings 
appropriate to the injury and to the theory of liability. Failure on the part of the plaintiff to achieve this end meant 
that his Action was dismissed. The plaintiff may therefore have failed for either of two reasons, first, 
because he had omitted from the Statement of his Cause of Action an Allegation required by the Substantive Law as 
essential to his Cause of Action; or second, because he has not presented his Cause of Action in the category of 
liability as called for by a Specific Form of Action. Selecting a “Form of Action,” then had to do with a 
theory of liability, it merely involved a selection of those Allegations required by the Substantive Law as essential 
to the Statement of a Specific Cause of Action.” 


The Practical Importance of Distinguishing Between the Different Forms of Action 

IN Maitland’s famous book on the Forms of Action at Common-Law,” he attempts, at the inception of his 
treatment, to explain or define the Forms of Action by pointing out that the choice between the various Forms of 
Action—Novel Disseisin, Mort d' Ancestor, Writ of Entry, Quare Impedit, Covenant, Debt, Detinue, Replevin, 
Trespass, Ejectment, Case and Assumpsit—”is a choice between Methods of Procedure adapted to Cases of 
different kinds”, With the greatest defer-

ence to such a distinguished scholar, exception must be taken to this statement. It is rather, as previously observed 
above, a choice between different theories of liability as represented by the various Forms of Action, Pursuing his 
thought, Professor Maitland suggests, quite properly, that there were incidental differences between the different 
Forms of Action with respect to: 
D Jurisdiction of the Courts.—Under this heading Professor Maitland observes that in most Civil Cases 
each of the Three Royal Courts was equally competent as to Jurisdiction, an end made possible by the use of a 
Fiction previously explained. ~ 


(I) Process.—Here it is pointed out that sometimes the defendant’s Appearance is compelled by a Summons 


and sometimes he may be Attached; or he may be forced to find gage and pledge for his Appearance. In at least one 
action, the Assize of Novel Disseisin, his bailiff might be Attached. 


Page 72 of 735 


In the event the defendant proves contumacious may one have his body seized, or, if he cannot be found, may 
he be outlawed? This barbaric Mode of Procedure was not applicable in all Forms of Action, although the 
tendency was in that direction. And the seizure of the thing in dispute varied with the Form of Action chosen. 


(III) Pleading.—With respect to this topic, it is suggested that each Form of Action has some Rules which 
are peculiar to it; that is that the General Issue in each Form is different, as for example, Nil Debet in Debt, Non 
Assumpsit in Special Assumpsit, Not Guilty in Trespass to Realty, and in others Nul Tort or Nul Disseisin. 

(IV) Judgment by Default.—Jlere the question is raised as to whether a Judgment may be obtained against an 
Adversary who is persistent in his contumacy, to which the

answer seems Yes in some Forms of Action and No in others. 


(V) Mode of TriaL—By the time the Forms of Action had reached a Status of Maturity, the chief Mode of Trial 
was by Jury. But there might be a Trial by a Grand or Petty Assize, and, of course, in an earlier time it was still 
possible that the issue could be determined by Trial by Battle. And finally, observes Professor Maitland, a few Is- 
sues were treated by the Judges who heard Witnesses. 


(VD Judgment.—If the plaintiff secures a Judgment how may it be enforced? On Execution may the plaintiff be 
placed in possession of the property in dispute? May the defendant be imprisoned or outlawed, or may he only be 
distrained? In addition to satisfying the plaintiff s demand, may he also be punished for his violation of the Law, 
and if so, what shall be the nature of such punishment—an Amercement, a Fine or Imprisonment? These may differ 
with the Form of Action. 


(VIE) Dilatory Character of Some Actions.—Some actions were susceptible to greater delay than others. Thus, 
in the Oldest Farms personal appearance of the parties was required, Attorneys being appointable by the 
King’s permission. Such Actions were subject to great delay, every type of excuse being allowed for the non- 
appearance, a short or a long Essoin being granted, as of course, there being no discretion. Again, in the Older 
Forms, an Essoin might be granted under which a party might betake himself to his bed for a year and a day, 
during which period of time the Action was Suspended. 


(V~) Measure of Damages and the Period of Limitations.—Ta the above we may add that the Measure of 
Damages differed, depending upon what choice of Action was made, and, of course, the Statutes of Lim- 
itations varied according as the Form of Action fell in the Contract, Property or Tort Field. 

Having concluded his story of the incidental differences between the different Forms of Action, Professor 
Maitland declares that “a Form of Action” implies “a particular Original Process, a particular Mesne Process, a 
particular Final Process, a particular Mode of Pleading, of Trial, of Judgment. But further to a very considerable 
degree the Substantive Law administered in a given Form of Action has grown up independently of the Law 
administered in other Forms. Each procedural pigeon-hole contains its own Rules of Substantive Law, and it is with 
great caution that we may argue from what is found in one to what will probably be found in another; each has its 
own Precedents. It is quite possible that a litigant will find that his Case will fit some two or three of these pigeon- 
holes. If that be so, he will have a choice, which will often be a choice between the old, cumbrous, costly, on the one 
hand, the modem, rapid, cheap, on the other. Or again he may make a bad choice, fail in his Action, and take such 
comfort as he can from the hints of the Judges that another Form of Action might have been more successful. The 
plaintiff's choice is irrevocable; he must play the rules of the game that he has chosen. Lastly he may find that, 
plausible as his Case may seem, it just will not fit any one of the receptacles provided by the Courts and he may 
take to himself the lesson that where there is no Remedy there is no Wrong.” G 


It may be admitted, as Professor Maitland says, that the Formulae of Pleading the Cause of Action and 


Page 73 of 735 


Defense, and even the Methods of Trial, Judgment and Execution, varied with the different Forms of Action. But 
this was not so in the beginning; it was not and could not be so until enough Writs had been issued to create the 
Forms of Action and a body of Substantive Law; these Forms of Action were not the product of a

FORMS OF ACTION

classificatory process that was or could be applied to pre-existing materials. Drawing up a description of the 
incidental differences between the different Forms of Action or setting up a Classification of the Forms of Action 
after the fact may serve the purpose of assisting in the identification of the Actions as finally developed or it might 
have aided the Lawyer as a guide in the selection of a Form of Action, but neither of these steps seems calculated to 
define a Form of Action, or to aid a beginning student in understanding what constitutes a Form of Action prior to 
the time he has traced the step-by-step process by which these Forms of Action finally assumed Definitive Form. A 
list of the incidents of the Forms of Action and an effort at classification both necessarily come after the fact of 
Development became a reality. And all this merely emphasizes that a choice between the Various Forms of Action 
was a choice between different theories of liability, and not a choice between different Methods of Procedure or 
relief. It was the theory of liability which was the keynote in Selecting a Form of Action and not the Incidental Dif- 
ferences in Procedure. The proof of that is that when, under our Modern Codes, these incidental differences in 
Procedure were removed and, under the Single, Formless Form of Action, all the Procedure in all Actions was 
reduced to uniformity, the Forms of Action remained. Thus, if B converted A’s watch, A was no longer to sue 
in the Form of Action formerly known as Trover, but in order to State a Good Cause of Action in the Nature of an 
Action on the Case, he was required to allege Possession or Right to Possession, Act of Conversion, and Damages. 
The essential differences in the Forms of Action were therefore in the Allegations necessary to show the Right of 
Action, in each Form, or to invoke the correct theory of liability represented in the selection of a Specitic Form 
of Action; the incidents of Procedural Difference probably developed in point 
of time long after the theory of liability had assumed its full play, in each Form of Action. The Law of the Forms of 
Action, therefore, is not the Law of Pleading and Practice, although the two are so intimately associated that it 
is easy to miss the distinction. 


The Misco ’itception of the Form.s of Action 


AS an incident of the development of the Forms of Action, Two Inflexible Rules of Pleading grew up, first that 
the Charge in the Declaration must conform to the Charge in the Original Writ; second, that the Charge proved at 
the Trial must conform to the Charge in the Declaration.’ Such Rules originated out of the fact that the Jurisdiction 
of a Specific Court was limited to the identical case as authorized by the Original Writ and developed by the 
Declaration. The same conformity was required in respect of the legal principle invoked, and not only in respect of 
the Facts alleged. Thus, as to Matters of Fact, the Proof must correspond with the Facts alleged; if the plaintiff 
Charges in his Declaration that the defendant took a black horse, and at the Trial offers evidence that the defendant 
took a white horse, he cannot succeed as he is guilty of a Variance between the Charge in the Declaration and the 
Proof at the Trial, which could be taken advantage of by a Motion For a Nonsuit. For a Variance between the 
Declaration and the Original Writ, a Plea in Abatement was the proper procedural device. A Variance between the 
Declaration and the Proof occurs when the plaintiff has misunderstood the actual state of Facts or has over-estimat- 
ed his ability to prove what he alleged. 


But a plaintiff may still lose although he knows the Facts of his case and is able to sustain the Burden of Proof; he 
may lose because of a mistake as to the legal effect of his Facts and as to the Legal Doctrine applicable thereto. 
Thus, suppose A charges

63 
B with conduct which he supposes amounts to a trespass when, as a matter of Substantive Law, the wrong in 


Page 74 of 735 


question actually creates a debt or amounts to no more than a conversion without a Trespass. If A in error sues B in 
Trespass, stating a case within the Law applicable to Trespass, it would constitute a glaring departure from true pro- 
cedural principle to allow the plaintiff to recover for the debt or the proved conversion.” In such a situation the 
plaintiff failed, because the Pleader, by the Form of Action in which he stated his case invoked a theory of liability 
or principle of Law relating to trespasses, whereas his right to recover was referable to an entirely distinct Doctrine 
of Law as represented by the Action of Trover. It follows therefore that the case proved is in legal implication 
entirely different from that Stated in the Declaration.” The same principle operates where, in an Action of Trover, the 
plaintiff fails in his Proof of a conversion but succeeds in establishing a trespass, and hence plaintiff fails to recover, 
as he is relying upon a theory of liability for conversion which has no application to Trespass; 10 likewise, where the 
plaintiff alleges Trover, but merely shows that the defendant permitted the goods to spoil; 11 under the Form of the 
Action of Trover, the theory is one of liability for a conversion, but the true theory of liability is one for negligence 
which invokes another doctrine of law entirely different in origin and in theory from that invoked by the Action of 
Trover. So, if the plaintiff brings Debt against the defendant

for goods sold and delivered, whereas in fact the defendant undertook to purchase the goods, and then refused to 
accept the goods upon Tender, the Action is misconceived,’’ as it assumes a liability for debt when there is no debt, 
but only a liability based upon a Breach of Contract, a liability created by a Rule of the Law of Contracts. Moreover, 
if in Debt, the Pleadings and Proof show that the defendant, not being indebted to the plaintiff, proftrised to pay to 
the plaintiff a debt owed by a third person, the plaintiff cannot recover, there being no obligation imposed by the 
Law upon the defendant to pay the debt; the defendant, if liable, was liable under a legal doctrine based upon a 
Breach of Promise. 


The mistake made by suing in a Form of Action which expresses a theory of liability not available in the case 
which the plaintiff has stated and proved is known as a Misconception of the Form of Action. Such a Defect is one 
of Substance, and has been insisted upon as a Fatal Defect, as it has been the policy of the Courts to preserve the 
Distinctions Between the Actions,” which in fact merely amounts to the observance of the differences between the 
distinct theories of liability or principles of Law.” 


The History of the Forms of Action is the History of Substantive Law ~

Events of the plaintiff's case were covered by any recognized theory of liability, as represented by a Particular 
Form of Action. The primary question before the Courts was not one of whether the plaintiff in the statement 
of his case had alleged a right in him, a violation of that right by the defendant, and Damages. It has been rather, 


Page 75 of 735 


whether the Operative Facts presented constituted a Cause of Action which fit into the theory of liability as 
represented by some Specific Form of Action, such as Assumpsit, or Trespass. This was neither a Matter of Pleading 
nor of Procedure generally; it was a question of Remedial Right, the existence of the Right being dependent 
upon the existence of a Remedy. 


From this it may be inferred that the list 

-of Original Writs not only determined the Jurisdiction of the Royal Superior Common-Law Courts, but it 
determined the existence of Remedial Rights and Liabilities. Long after the Original Writs ceased to be essential to 
authorize the Courts to act in a specific case, the Judges felt impelled to consider the case exactly as if it had been 
begun by an Original Writ and to govern the exercise of their Jurisdiction according to the recognized occasions of 
Remedy. Even though the Writs became in time a mere formality, and were superseded as the Method of 
Commencing the Action, the Principle of Jurisdiction remained as if still actually governed by the Original 
Writ, and the theories of liability, as if represented by the various Forms of Action, were still observed as being 
the sole occasion of remedial intervention. °

Imm Brevum’’ was not a reasoned or well-rounded Scheme of Remedial Justice; it was not the product of a 
skilled Legislator selected by providence to calmly devise theorems of Remedial Rights for all conceivable 
wrongs. Nor was this list the result of a rational Classification of Theories of Liability or of Causes of Action 
according to the character of the Rights and claims to be presented; the Forms of Action, representing Theories of 
Liability, were relatively few and arbitrary, when measured by the myriads of human situations in which human 
beings were bound to be seeking some Form of Remedial Relief. Nor were the Theories of Liability as seen in the 
Forms of Action comprehensive and logical; they just grew; yet the stream of rights flowed down these channels, 
with the well recognized result that the history of these Theories of Liability is the History of the Development of 
English Substantive Law. Thus when Glanvill and Bracton wrote concerning the Law of England they were 
compelled to write about the Writs, as the Law could only be found in their interstices. In their thy this involved the 
Forms of Action known as the Ancient Proprietary and Possessory Real Actions; in a later or more modern day 
a discussion of Debt, Covenant, Account or Assumpsit, is necessarily a discussion of the development of the Law 
of Contracts; that of Trespass and Case is a discussion of the Law of Torts; that of Detinue, Replevin, Ejectment and 
Trover is usuaily a discussion of Property; in short, a History of the Forms of Action, both Ancient and Modern, 
would fall little short of a Complete History of the Common Law. Had the authority of the Clerks in Chancery been 
less restricted in their practice of issuing New Writs and had the Judges been more liberal in extending the Reme- 
dial Scope of the various Forms of Action,

and particularly the Great Residuary Remedy of the Common Law—the Action of Trespass on the Case—their 
Remedies might have effectually answered many of the purposes of a Court of Equity and thus made its creation 
unnecessary. 


The Law was required to express itself through the Limited System of Writs and Forms of Action 


sanctioned by precedent, and little discretion was left to the Judge. The Common Law, thus hampered and restricted 
was found insufficient to meet certain demands for Justice; a distinct Tribunal arose, so it is said, to supply the 


Page 76 of 735 


deficiencies of the Common Law and to give Justice where the Common Law Remedies were inadequate, 
namely, the Court of Chancery, which in legal theory gave a Remedy where there was a right, on principles of 
natural justice, to meet the exigencies as they arose, so that no wrong should exist without a remedy. Aside from the 
soundness of these last observations concerning the Supplementary Functions of Equity, it is clear that the 
Classification and Definition of the Different Species of Contracts and Tarts, even at the present day, are based on 
the historic distinction between the different theories of liability as represented by the Forms of Action and the 
Remedies available thereunder. The test of the existence of liability and of the amount of Damages due may 
depend upon whether one Form or another is applicable. It follows, therefore, that in order to understand the 
intricacies of the Law, it is necessary to approach it by the study of the various theories of Remedial Right 
available under the Forms of Action at Common Law which have been recognized by the Courts. Or, to put the 
matter in a broader way, practically all of our Modern Substantive Contract, Property and Torts Law, had its 
origin in and developed out of the Theories of Liability represented by the Forms of Action and the 
Procedural Incidents thereto. 

The Phrqse~ “Form of Action” Defined 


WITH the distinction between a Cause of Action and a Form of Action in mind, with some understanding 
of the different Doctrines of the Different Actions, with some comprehension of what constitutes a Miscon- 
ception of a Form of Action, as —vell as the knowledge that the History of the Forms of Action is the History of 
Substantive Law, we are at last ready to attempt to define a “Form of Action.” 

The phrase “Form of Action” has been defined as the “technical Mode of Framing the Writ, and Pleadings 
appropriate to the particular injury”,”” as the Method of Procedure adapted to a specific kind of case. Nothing 
could be farther from the truth. The law governing Forms of Action is not the Law of Pleading or Procedure, though 
it is closely associated therewith. The choice of One Form of Action over Another is primarily a choice between 
different Theories of Substantive Liability, and the Scope of the Various Actions measures the existence 
and extent of liability at Common Law. In other words the Cause of Action had to fit the Theory of 
Liability as represented by a Specific Form of Action. And this remained true even when the incidental 
differences in procedure were removed, and the Procedure in All Actions was reduced to uniformity. Thus, after 
England and most states abolished the necessity of choosing one of these specified theories in Commencing an 
Action, the Forms of Action remained in substance. “The Forms of Action we have buried.” Yet, though we have 
buried them, observes Professor Maitland, -. they still rule us from their graves.” 19 The names and the-aries of 
the Forms of Action as they existed at Common Law still indicate the Recognized

Ch. 2 

Causes of Action, the occasions of liability, and the starting point of legal doctrine. The essential differences 
were in the Allegations of Fact necessary to show the Right of Action in each Form; in other words, in their 
respective grounds and theories of liability. And this is true even under the Code~° Some cases may fall under 
two or three of these theories of liability, and a litigant will have a choice or Election between them. 


By way of summary then, it may be asserted that a “Farm of Action” is not a choice between Methods of 
Procedure or Relief; it is not to be confused with a Cause of Action; it is not a General Demand for Reilef 
based on a Specific Wrong as might be made under a Non-Formulary system of procedure. Rather a “Form of 
Action” may be defined as a Procedural Device whereby the primitive mind gave concrete expression to a theory of 
liability; it is a mechanism through which the doctrine or principle of Law applicable to the Statement of a Plain- 
tiff’ s Cause of Action may be enforced; it provides a scheme whereby it may be determined whether the plaintiff’ s 
alleged Cause of Action fits into any judicially recognized Theory of Liability; it is a device, an incidence of the 
existence of which determines the Formulae of Pleading the Cause of Action and Defence, the Method of Proof and 
Trial, and the Judgment and Execution, these varying with each Form of Action; it is the Frame within which a 


Page 77 of 735 


plaintiff could suggest the facts constituting his Claim for Relief in accordance with the appropriate Rule of Sub- 
stantive Law applicable thereto; and finally, it is the mechanism through which an unnamed short, but not 
unidentifiable Charge in the Original Writ—the keynote of the Form of Action—is, through the Statement of the 


SO. “While the New Rules have abolished the distinctive Common-Law Forms, the essential and differentlathig Rules applicable to 
Pleading as estab. flailed at Common Law SUN sun,tve as a Basis of Remedial Law.” Minturn, S, In Ward t Huff, 94 N.J.L. 81, 84, 109 
A. 287, 288 (1*20). 

Substantive Facts in the Declaration, converted into an enforceable liability, the Declaration as finally developed 

being but an amplification of the Original Writ, “with the additional circumstances of time and place” 21 set forth 

in a more narrative and spacious form. 


The Mode of Pleading Under Modern Codes and Practice Acts 

THE Forms of Action as finally developed are usually associated and discussed with Common Law 
Pleading, but they relate to the Substantive Law of Contract, Property and Tort rather than to Procedure. 
Forms of Action are the recognized Theories of Liability through which the Common Law Rights of 
Action have been evolved, classified and formulated. As such they are much more important than any mere 
Rules of Pleading. The abolition of the requirement of selecting a particular one of these theories of liability 
has emancipated Pleading from arbitrary Variations of Procedure in different kinds of Actions. While 
necessarily the Rights and Liabilities and Defenses depend on Substantive Law, only the manner in which 
the Calm or Defense shall be set forth depends upon Rules of Pleading, which are made the same for All 
Actions in Modern Procedure. But there are still many Code States which insist that the Pleader shall select 
and adhere to some Theory of Liability in stating his Cause of ActionP 


The Forms of Action, and the necessity of choosing between them, have been abolished by the Codes in the 
Several States, following the pattern set by the New York Code of Procedure of 1848.23 Thus, in New 
York,

Forms of those Actions and Suits, have been abolished.” 24 In the famous New York case of Goulet v. Asseler,”” in 
reference to this type of Statute Abolishing the Forms of Action, Selden, J., observed: “Although the Code 
[of Procedure] has abolished 26 all distinction between the mere Forms of Action, and every Action is now in 
Form a Special Action on the Case, yet Actions vary in their Nature, and there are intrinsic differences 
between them which No Law can abolish. It is impossible to make an Action for a direct aggression upon the 
plaintiff’s rights, by taking and disposing of his property, the same thing, in Substance

or in Principle, as an Action to recover for the conseguential injury resulting from an improper interference with 
the property of another, in which he has a contingent or prospective interest. The mere Formal Differences between 
such Actions are abolished; the Substantial Differences remain as before. The same Proof, therefore, is reguired 
in each of these Two Kinds of Actions, as before the Code, and the same Rule of Damages applies.” 27 

In many of the States which retain the Forms of Action, the Common Law Forms have been combined or 
modified by Statute. In Massachusetts, actions were Classified as either in Contract or Tort, while in

Michigan, at one time at least, Contract Actions were all called Assumpsit, and Tort Actions for Damages were 
called Trespass on the Case.

now turn our attention to the system of Offensive Pleadings as developed by Common-Law Procedure. 

In its broadest scope, Procedure has to do with Pleading, Practice and Evidence; the steps by which 
proceedings are conducted in

Sec. 14 
THE COURT

THE COURT 

14. A Court is a tribunal duly constituted, and present at the time and place fixed by Law for Judicial 
Investigation and Determination of Controversies. And there are Courts of General and Special 
Jurisdiction, Courts of Original and Appellate Jurisdiction and Courts of Record and Not of Record. The 
procedure under which these Courts operate may be governed by Legislative Rules or Rules of Court, the 
modern tendency being in the direction of the latter method. 


In General 


WHEN a client consults a lawyer concerning some controversy in which he is involved, what he 
wishes to know is whether he has a civil action against his adversary. “A civil action at Common Law is a 
proceeding in a Court of Justice for the purpose of obtaining redress for the violation of a legal right.” ~ If, 
after an analysis of the Facts of the client’s case, the lawyer decides that he has a Cause of Action, then he 
must determine what Court has Jurisdiction over the supposed action. Therefore, before considering the 
Problem of Jurisdiction, it may be well to inquire as to what is a Court? According to .Anderson’s Law 
Dictionary the word “Court” 
originally could signify only a yard or palace, and according to Cowel it meant the house where the King 
remained with his retinue; also the place where Justice was administered.* In early Anglo-Saxon and 
Anglo-Norman times it referred to the place of the King’s domicile as the King was the fountain-head and 
Dispenser of Justice. During this primitive period of development

“An Action Is nothing else but a lawful demand of right.” Borne, The Mlrrour of Justices, c. I, Of Actlons, 74 (With an 


Introduction by William 0. Robinson, Washington, 1). 0., 1003). See, also, Cohens ‘cc VIrginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 at 407, 408

the Courts were popular assemblages held in the courtyard of the baron or of the King himself by those whose 
duty it was to appear at stated times or upon Summons. With this idea in mind Blackstone defined a Court as “a 
place where Justice is Judicially Administered,” and at least one American Court accepted his definition.” But it 
has been regarded as too narrow, it being concluded that a Court is a tribunal duly constituted and present 
at the time and place fixed by law for Judicial Investigation and Determination of Controversies.’ And it 
has sometimes been regarded as an incorporeal thing requiring for its existence the’ presence of a Judge. It 
should, however, be understood that the Court does not consist of the Judge or Judges as individuals, but 
only when at the proper time and place they are exercising their Judicial powers.” And there are different 
kinds of Courts, as, for example, when viewed from the standpoint of Jurisdiction, 


Different Kinds of Courts 


THUS, Courts may be either one or two descriptions—of General Jurisdiction or of Special Jurisdiction. 
As classified in this manner, it is observed that a Court with General Jurisdiction is one which has all the 
power which a Superior Court of the Common Law had, and it may hear a wide variety of cases. A Court of 
Special Jurisdiction is one whose Jurisdiction is limited by Constitution or Statute and hence may only hear 
and decide specific cases. When the Court is one of General Jurisdiction, its Jurisdiction is presumed and 
need not be expressly asserted by the plaintiff; but when the Jurisdiction is

limited, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing the Court’s Jurisdiction.’ 

A Court may also be either of Original or of Appellate Jurisdiction. Original Jurisdiction consists of a 
Court’s authority to decide a case in the first instance; and Appellate Jurisdiction consists of the Court’s 
authority to review and correct the errors alleged to have been committed by a lower or Subordinate Court. To 
put the matter another way, the Court of Original Jurisdiction is a Trial Court, readily accessible to the people in 
such locality where the witnesses are heard and a Judgment is rendered, whereas a Court of Appellate 
Jurisdiction acts upon the Record made in the lower Court; it is farther removed from the people and among its 
purposes is not only that of reviewing the errors of inferior Courts, but also that of bringing uniformity in 
the law throughout the territory over which it exercises Appellate Jurisdiction. 


Courts may also be either of record or not of record.'* The former includes Courts in which the 
proceedings therein are recorded on parchment for a perpetual memorial and testimony, the Records of 
which may be offered in other Courts as conclusive evidence of the facts stated, ~‘hereas the latter refers to a 
Court whose Records are not so regarded in other Courts, or at most are regarded only as prima fade evidence 
of the facts stated therein. By Statute in some states the Statute of Limitations on a Judgment of Record is 
twenty years; on a Judgment of a Court not of Record six years.” 


JURISDICTION OF COURTS 
15. Jurisdiction depends upon authority over the subject~matter and over the parties. 


IN general, Jurisdiction is the power of a Court to hear cases and decide them by pro.

nouncing Judgment. And the power to render Judgment depends: (1) upon Jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the 


action or of the class of cases; and (2) upon Jurisdic tion over the parties.” 


Derivation of Jurisdiction 

THE Judicial Powers and the Jurisdiction of the Courts of the States and of the United States are in 
general derived from their respective Constitutions and are further defined and fixed by Statutes enacted 
thereunder. Such Written Law prescribes the Nature of the Causes that may be brought within the 
cognizance of the respective Courts. In England, however, and by way of contrast, the source of the power 
and authority of the Common Law Courts to afford the relief asked was anciently the Original Writ, a 
delegation from the King in each instance. Such a Writ was the warrant of authority under which a particular 
Common Law Court took cognizance of the cause,’* In course of time the Jurisdiction of the Law Courts became 
fixed and established as to those matters in which Writs were demandable of common right. In time, however, 
Original Writs fell out of use as a regular means of Commencing an Action. Nonetheless they left behind 
them a dearly defined Jurisdiction and the limited system of remedies under the Forms of Action, each of 
which will be considered in detail. 


The Problem of Jurisdiction in Englond and America Distinguishe4 
IN approaching the Problem of Jurisdiction of American Courts, the student is faced with 


Page 81 of 735 


complications not present under the English System. In England a precedent once established on a particular 
subject became the Law of the land, whereas in the United States, each State had an independ

ent Judiciary, except as limited by the Federal Constitution or by Federal Statute.'* Superimposed above 
the states, whose Judiciaries were not only substantially independent of the Federal Government, but were 
also independent of each other, was the Federal System of Courts, consisting of a Supreme Court, and 
“such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,” is While the Judicial 
Powers of the State Courts were general and undefined, limited only by those reserved to the Federal 
Courts,’ the powers which could be exercised by the National Courts were confined within limits strictly 
defined by the Federal Constitution. Thus, under the Constitution, the Supreme Court had Original 
Jurisdiction only “in all cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in 
which a State shall be a Party.”” In all other cases, the Supreme Court had Appellate Jurisdiction over 
certain decisions of the State Supreme Courts, and the Inferior Federal Courts, “with such Exceptions, and 
under such Regulations as Congress shall make.” is 


Duality of Jurisdiction 

IN England, even after some elasticity was afforded by the flexible nature of the Action on the Case, a 
large Jurisdiction was still unprovided I or. To meet this lack of remedy, it is said that the Court of Chan- 
cery was created, in which the Chancellor

15. U.S.Const., art. II, § 1. 


16. The Laws enacted by the congress of the United States are Law in the Several States. Accordingly, the right of a State Court to protect 
rights granted by a Federal Statute cannot be questioned. Congress may, however, where a right Is created by a 


Federal Enactment, give the Federal courts Er-elusive Jurisdiction. See article by Reppy, Civil Remedies and Procedure, In 1942, Annual 
Surv.Am. L. 791, 512 (New York, 1942). 


17. Art. II, § 2, ci. 2. 

gave Equitable Relief and dispensed complete Justice where it was urged, for one reason or another, that 
there was no adequate remedy at Common Law. The Jurisdiction of Equity was residuary and 
supplemental to the Law, based on a delegation by the Council of Judicial Authority not previously dele- 
gated to the older Courts. Such is the source of the great division of Jurisdiction into Legal and Equitable, 
allotting certain kinds of actions and relief to one set of Courts and the remainder to another. The line of 
demarkation between Legal and Equitable Jurisdiction is thus historical in origin and arbitrary in fact. 
Nevertheless, the duality of Courts and Jurisdiction has to be kept constantly in mind, as it had a direct bearing 
upon how Jurisdiction in a given case was to be secured by the Common Law Courts and the Court of 
Chancery, and the powers which they exercised.

appear and answer the plaintiff’s Declaration. The Commencement of an Action at Common Law was 
formerly by Original Writ. Judicial Process was by Summons, Attachment, Arrest or Outlawry. 


tn General 
ACCORDING to Miller,” in practically all 


Systems of Procedure, the Parties to an Action are entitled to be heard or to have an opportunity to be heard, 
before the Judicial Machinery of a State becomes operative. In the United States, under both State and Federal 
Constitutions, due process of law requires due notice and an opportunity to be heard.”! It follows, therefore, that in 
order to Commence an Action, it is highly essential that the defendant shall have due notice and an opportunity to 
present his version of the controversy. This was the primary function of Judicial Process in its various forms. 


Original Writ 
AT Common Law, as previously observed, an action was begun by suing an Original Writ out of 
Chancery, in the King’s name, which served the purpose of ordering the Sheriff to give the defendant 
notice, determined the character of the action, and auburgh 1727); Bohure, The English Lawyer, Showing the Nature

thorized a specific Court to hear the cause. Substituted in lieu of the Original Writ, the Modern Summons is also 
issued in the name of the Sovereign, and is directed against the defendant. Although the Summons does not 
have all of the attributes of the Original Writ, it does serve as an effective instrument for Commencing an Action. 
With these comments in mind, we may now consider the varieties of Judicial Process by which Jurisdiction 
over the parties to an action may be acquired. 


Commencement of an Action in Modern Practice 

IN Modern Practice the Original Writ is no longer used either as authority for instituting an action, or for the 
purpose of compelling appearance by the defendant,” though in some of our states the term is retained to 
designate the process that has talc-en its place. No Writ at all is necessary for instituting actions, and the 
Writ of Summons is used as a means of notifying the defendant of the suit and ordering him to appear in 
Court. The practice is very generally, if not entirely, regulated by Statutes, varying somewhat from State to 


Page 83 of 735 


State. 


The general practice is for the attorney, in Commencing an Action, to draw up, sign and present to the 
Clerk of the Court, an order requesting him to issue a Summons. This order is called a praccipe. It is not es- 
sential to the validity of the Summons, but is used merely as a convenient way of directing the Clerk as to 
its issuance. A verbal direction would do as well~

THE first Process upon the Original Writ 


in tontract actions and for civil injuries unaccompanied by force was a Summons, or warning to appear

defendant, to be held as security for the satisfaction of the plaintiff’s claim. 


Such a Writ always issued before Judgment, and thus differs from an Execution, which is the Process 
issued after Judgment, In some States it can be issued only against absconding debtors or persons 
concealing themselves, or nonresidents; in others, it is issued, in the first instance, to obtain control over 
the property of the defendant with which to satisfy the Judgment. 


At Common Law, the Attachment was used to compel the appearance of the defendant, and, when he 
has appeared, the Attachment was dissolved. There was no lien upon the goods to secure the debt. The 
Writ is now issued to attach personal property and real estate to respond to the Judgment. The defendant 
may appear or not, after having been served with the Summons; if not, he is defaulted, and the 
Attachment constitutes a ilen on the goods for the payment of the claim sued on, which may be enforced 
by Execution. The defendant may, however, generally appear at any time before Judgment, and dissolve 
the Attachment by giving a bond, in which case the attached property is released, the bond standing in its 
place.”

As a general rule the Action is deemed to be Commenced when the Writ is issued, although to stop the 
running of the Statute of Limitations some Courts hold that the Writ must be delivered to the officer for 
service. But others hold that this is not necessary.”

SERVICE—PERSONAL AND 
CONSTRUCTIVE 


17. Jurisdiction to render a Personal Judgment is based on Personal Service of a Summons, or sometimes on 
Substituted Service. Jurisdiction in Rem, and Quasi in Rem is based on Constructive Service by Publication and Control of some 
rca. 


In General 


PERSONAL Judgment must be based upon Personal Service of Summons upon the defendant, or in case of 
residents upon Substituted Service. Constructive Service of Process by Publication is by Statute authorized where 
the Court has Jurisdiction in Rem or Quasi in Rem. For the latter case seizure of some property by Attachment or 
otherwise is necessary.” 


PERSONAL Judgments must be based upon Defendant Personally 

THERE is a most important distinction between the Jurisdiction which is based on personal service,” and 
Jurisdiction which is based upon control over some res or subject matter, which is under the power of the Court. 
Only by virtue of Personal Jurisdiction can the Court render a personal Judgment and create a personal obligation 
which will bind all the defendant’s property everywhere. 


The ordinary method by which a Court gets authority to adjudicate upon the rights and liabilities of the defendant 
is by Service of Summons upon him personally within the state. There are statutory provisions as to the officer or 
agent upon whom the Summons shall be served in actions against corporations. The service, when personal, may be 
made at any time after the Writ comes into the hands of the officer, but not later than the time fixed by Statute, 
which may be the Return Day or a certain time before. The officer is bound to use due diligence in serving 


3°. Pennoyer v. Neff, 05 U.s. 714, 24 LEd. 565 (1877).

it, and is liable for neglect or a false Return. Having made the service, it is his duty to Return the Writ to the Court 
from which it issued, with his report of service, or that the defendant cannot be found 32 within his Jurisdiction 


Page 86 of 735 


indorsed thereon, which is called his “Return”. 


The act of notifying him of the Commencement of the Action is generally performed by reading the Writ to him, 
or handing him a copy of it, or, as is now generally provided by Statute, by leaving a copy at his last usual place 
of abode, if he has one within the Jurisdiction of the Court.” 


Substituted Service 

SUBSTITUTED Service, by leaving a copy of the Summons at the defendant’s residence or usual place of 
abode, may by Statute be made equivalent to Personal Service as to a resident defendant, and it will support a 
Personal Judgment. “Substituted Service in actions in personam is a departure from the Common Law Rule 
requiring Personal Service, and the Statute authorizing such service must be followed strictly. But when the Statute 
is complied with, the general rule is that Substituted Service on a resident defendant is equivalent to Personal 
Service and warrants a Personal Judgment.” ~

Burdick, Service in Actions in Personam, 20 Mich. L.Rev. 422, 425 (1925); and that Substituted Service of Process, by posting of Writ on the

of a Summons by delivering a copy without reading the Writ to the defendant and in which it was held that such service was iasufficient.

Courts have no general power to Summon non-residents ~ and persons resident in one state are not subject to the 
exercise of Personal Jurisdiction over them by Courts in another.” If they hold property there, however, they are 
subject to have their property rights adjudicated by a Judgment in Rem. Mere temporary presence in the state is 
sufficient to subject the non-resident individual to its power if Personal Service of Summons is secured therein, even 
if the defendant is merely passing through on a train. But foreign corporations cannot be served, unless doing 
business in the state. When once obtained, Jurisdiction continues through all subsequent proceedings in the same 
litigation without further notice. 


Constructive Service: Jurisdiction in Rem 

IN certain exceptional cases a Court may acquire a limited Jurisdiction in Rem by notice sent to a non-resident 
outside the state or published within it, which is regarded as sufficient to give him a reasonable oppori-linri. 256, 63

tunity to appear and defend. But a Court cannot acquire Jurisdiction to pronounce a Personal Judgment against 

one who has no residence within the state, except by actual service of notice upon him within the state, or by his 
voluntary appearance. 


Page 87 of 735 


Jurisdiction in Rem is Jurisdiction in a cause acquired by virtue of control over the subject-matter. All 
proceedings are really directed against persons and their rights, even though, as in admiralty, a res or ship be 
impleaded as defendant. Some notification of the proceedings is therefore essential, either by publication in 
newspapers, or by posting up notices, or by mailing notices to the last known address, or by service of Summons 
outside of the state. A Court order must in general be obtained to make service of the Summons by Publication 
or other substituted method, upon a showing by affidavit that Personal Service within the state cannot be had.” 


Constructive Service: Jurisdiction Quasi-in-Rem 
THERE has been a wide extension of the Doctrine of Jurisdiction in Rem to cases where there is no direct claim 
to a tangible ret Thus, where a suit is brought upon an obligation against a non-resident debtor, the 


37. The Process of the Court is said to “run” only within the Limits of its own Jurisdiction, and only by service within those limits is Jurisdiction 
to pronounce Personal Judgment against a defendant without his voluntary appearnce acquired. Penfoyer v. Neff, 90 U.S. 714, 24 LEd. 
565 (1877); Coldcy v, Morning News of New Haven, 156 U.S. 518, 15 S.Ct. 559, 39 LEd. 517 (1895); International Harvester Co. v. 
Commonwealth of Kentucky, 234 U_S. 579, 34 S.Ct. 944, 58 L.Ed. 1479 (1914). 


According to some authorities, no Personal Judgments can be rendered, even against a resident, merely on the basis of an Attachment of the 
property and Publication of Summons. De Arman v. Massey, 151 Ala. 639, 44 So. 688 (1907).

Court may subject the property of the debtor within the state to the payment of the debt, even though no Personal 
Jurisdiction over him can be acquired. No claim is made to the property as such, the plaintiff is not seeking to cut 
off the defendant’s right, title or interest in the property as against the whole world; he does have an interest in the 
property, but it Is purely incidental to the satisfaction of his claim for the redress of a wrong, any surplus remaining 
thereafter going to the defendant, and not to the plaintiff. It is held that where a claim is made to property indirectly 
to thus satisfy an obligation of a non-resident debtor, an Attachment or Garnishment or Receivership is necessary. 
Since the action is not so framed as to set up any direct claim to the res in the sense of seeking to cut off the 
defendant’s interest as against the whole world, a claim to specific property, as an incidental method of obtaining 
redress for a wrong, must be asserted in some manner, since Jurisdiction is based upon that. And the defendant must 
have notice of that claim in order to satisfy the requirements of due process of law. And the method of giving 
such notice is by seizure of the property by the Court prior to service by publication.” Such seizure will give the 
Court Jurisdiction Quasi in Rem. A Judgment based on such Jurisdiction is not in personarn, and in this regard it is 
to be observed that the only effect of the Judgment is to enable the plaintiff to satisfy his claim out of the 
attached property; any part of the property after the payment of the plaintiff s demand remains the property of 
the defendant, although the 


38.The leading ease on the necessity af seizure by the court in order to properly ground Service by Publication In suits Quasi in Rem, is Pennoyer 
v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714,24 LEd. 565 (1877). 


See, also, the following cases: Baillie v. Columbia Gold Mm. CO., 86 Or. 1, 22, 42, 168 P. 965, rehearing denied 86 Or. 1, 161 F. 1167 (1917). 


See, Hohfeld, rundaaiiental Legal Conceptions, 26 Yale L.J. 710, 781 (1917); Shipley v, Shipley, 187 Iowa 1293, 175 NW. 51 (1919). 
character of said property may have been changed, as when real estate is sold on Execution for more than the 
amount of the demand, in which case the defendant receives the balance as personal property. 


The Operation of the Doctrine of Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction is best illustrated by the case of Pennoyer v. Neff ~ in 
which appeared that A, in the state of Oregon, was sued in Debt for service rendered by an attorney; that at the 
time the action began and the Judgment was rendered, A, the then defendant, was a non-resident of the state; that he 
was not personally served with Process, and did not appear therein; and that the Judgment was entered upon his 
default in not answering the complaint, upon a Constructive Service of Summons by Publication. Such service 
when an action is brought against a non-resident and absent defendant, who has property within the state, was pro- 


Page 88 of 735 


vided for by the Code of Oregon. The Code also provided, where the action was for the recovery of money or 
damages, for the Attachment of the property of the non-resident. It also declared that no natural person was subject 
to the Jurisdiction of a Court of the State “unless he appear in the Court, or be found within the State, or be a 
resident thereof, or have property therein; and, in the last case, only to the extent of such property at the time the 
Jurisdiction attached.” 


The plaintiff, B, in the original action having secured a Default Judgment for less than $300 including costs, sued 
out an Execution on the Judgment, and C acquired the premises in question under a Sheriff's deed, made upon a 
sale of the property on Execution issued upon the Judgment. Thereafter, A, the defendant in the original action, sued 


O in Ejectment to recover the land, of the alleged value of $15,000, situated in the State of Oregon. The issue 
thus presented was whether the Judgment in the State Court

COMMENCEMENT OF AN ACTION 
against A, the then defendant, but in this action, the plaintiff, was void for want of Personal Service of 
Process upon him, or of his appearance in the action in which it was rendered, and whether the premises in 
controversy could be subjected to the payment of the demand of a resident creditor, The Court discussed the 
requirement of due process of law under the United States Constitution when applied to a judicial proceeding, and 
in particular as related to the question of a Court obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant. Mr. Justice Field, speaking 
for the United States Supreme Court, held that the Judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the Circuit Court should be 
affirmed, because the only question was as to the validity of the original money Judgment rendered in Oregon, 
in an Action of Debt on a Simple Contract, against the resident of another state, without his voluntary 
appearance, or personal service of process upon him, by Attachment of the property subsequent to the 
commencement of the Action. Prior Attachment was and is necessary in order to give notice to the defendant that his 
property was involved in litigation. Without such notice the defendant’s property might be taken without a 
hearing or an opportunity to be heard, which would be violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment. Finally, it is interesting to observe that in the principal case, even the Supreme Court failed to 
distinguish clearly between Jurisdiction in Rem as opposed to Jurisdiction Quasi in Rem.”

IN discussing the subject of Appearance, it is important to distinguish between the plaintiff and defendant. In 
beginning the action by either an Original or Judicial Writ returnable to a Specific Court, the plaintiff automatically 
submitted himself to its Jurisdiction. He was, therefore, not required to appear for any purpose prior to the 
appearance of the defendant,” If he failed to file his Declaration and prosecute his action upon the defendant’s 
appearance, he was subject to a Nonsuit upon the defendant’s Motion after a demand in writing that the plaintiff 


Page 89 of 735 


should plead. Such a Nonsuit carried costs enforceable against him and his pledges. Under the Hilary Rules of 1834

upon failure to appear and plead within one year after the Return of the Writ. 


The Doctrine of Appearance properly relates to the defendant, as his actual presence in person or through his 
attorney was a condition precedent to any Form of Pleading, to any Trial, or to any Judgment in the case. An 
Appearance is any unequivocal act by which a defendant submits to the Jurisdiction of the Court in a Cause of 
Action.” This is, in effect, a definition of a General Appearance. A Special Appearance is one made for the purpose 
of objecting to the Court’s Jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or over the person of the defendant. If 
the Court has not previously acquired Jurisdiction of the defendant, such an appearance enables the defendant to ob- 
ject to the control, without submitting himself to its jurisdiction.“ 


Under Modern Law a Court can acquire Jurisdiction to render a Judgment in person-ant eithcr by a General 
Appearance on the part of the defendant or by the Personal Service of a Summons. If, however, the defendant or his 
attorney does any act with ref erence to the Defense of the action, he will be held to have submitted himself to the 
authority of the Court, or to have made a General Appearance, the effect of which is to cure all prior defects in the 
service.” Since Jurisdiction over subject matter is defined by Constitution or Statute in America, consent of the 
parties cannot confer such Jurisdiction upon the Court, and therefore an Appearance

by the defendant constitutes no waiver of the objection that the Court has no Jurisdiction over the subject 
matter.’° A defendant may, however, waive Jurisdiction over his person, which he in effect does when he 
makes a Voluntary or General Appearance. 


The English Courts did not, until modern times, claim Jurisdiction over the person of the defendant merely by 
service of Summons upon him. If he failed to appear in response to the Summons, it was deemed necessary to resort 
to further Process by Attachment of his Property and Arrest of his Person to compel an “appearance”, which was 
not mere presence in the Court, but which consisted of some act by which a person submitted himself to the 
authority and Jurisdiction of the Court. If he still failed to appear, no Judgment could be rendered against him, 
except in Real Actions where the defendant was proceeding against the Jand within the Jurisdiction. Any steps in the 
action, such as giving bail soupon arrest, operated as an appearance or submission. 


Page 90 of 735 


Under later English law, by Statute, the plaintiff was authorized upon affidavit of Personal Service of a 
Summons or a Writ of Distringas, to enter the appearance of the defendant, and proceed to Judgment, if he failed to 
appear within a certain prescribed time. The effect of this practice was to

eliminate the Process of Attachment and Arrest as a means of compelling the defendant’s appearance, except 
where Personal Service was unobtainable, in which instance the Ancient Mesne Process to Outlawry re- 
mained operative.” But the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852 s2 abolished the Writ of Distringas, 
together with the practice of plaintiff entering the appearance of the defendant. 


Under Modern Law there is no effort to compel the appearance of the defendant. But if he be properly 
served and then neglects to Appear and Plead, the Court will render Judgment against him for Default of 
Appearance. Inasmuch as the Default constitutes an admission of the Cause of Action set forth in the 
Declaration, assuming of course that the plaintiff has stated a Cause of Action, all that the plaintiff would 
have to prove is his damages. 


THE PLEADINGS 


19. On the Appearance of the Parties, the Pleadings Commence. The Various Pleadings and their order 
are as follows: 

(1) The Declaration of the plaintiff. 
The Dilatory Pleas of the defendant. 
The Demurrer or Plea of the defendant. 

(IV) The Demurrer or Replication of the plaintiff. 
(V)The Demurrer or Rejoinder of the defendant. 
(VI) The Demurrer or Surrejoinder of the plaintiff. 


(VID The Demurrer or Rebutter of the defendant. 
(VIII) The Demurrer or Surrebutter of the plaintiff.

Mode of Pleading 


STEPHEN thus describes how the Pleadings were once orally delivered: ~ “As the appearance was an 
actual one, so the Plead~ ing was an Oral Altercation in Open Court, in presence of the Judges. ... These 
Oral Pleadings were delivered either by the Party himself or his Pleader, called ‘narrator’ and ‘advocatus’ 
; and it seems that the Rule was then already established that none but a regular advocate (or, according to 
the more modern term, ‘barrister’) could be a Pleader in a cause not his own. 


“It was the office of the Judges to superintend, or, according to the allusion of a learned writer, 


moderate the oral contention thus conducted before them. In doing this, their general aim was to compel 
the Pleaders so to manage their Alternate Allegations as at length to arrive at some specific point or 


Page 91 of 735 


matter affirmed on the one side and denied on the other. When this matter was attained, if it proved to be 
a Point of Law, it fell, of course, to the decision of the Judges themselves, to whom alone the adjudication 
of all legal questions belonged; but, if a Point of Fact, the parties then, by mutual agreement, referred it to 
one of the various Methods of Trial then practiced, or to such Trial as the Court should think proper. This 
result being attained, the parties were said to be at issue (ad exitum; that is, at the end of their pleading). 
The question, so set apart for decision was itself called ‘the issue’, and was designated, according to its 
nature, either as an “issue in fact’ or an “issue in law’. The whole proceeding then closed, in case of an 
Issue in Fact, by an award or order of the Court, directing the institution, at a given time, of the Mode of 
Trial fixed upon;

or, in case of an Issue in Law, by an adjournment of the parties to a given day, when the Judges should be 
prepared to pronounce their decision.” 


The practice of oral pleading has long since ceased. The Modern Practice is to draw up Written Pleadings in 
typewritten form, and file them in the office of the proper officer of the Court, usually the Clerk’s office. Here 
the opposite party may examine a pleading, or he may procure a copy from the officer; 
or it may be that under the statutes of the particular state, or a Rule of the Court, a copy may be required to be 
delivered to him. When the Pleadings are thus filed they become a part of the Record of the cause. They are not, as 
formerly, transcribed, but are themselves properly indorsed and kept on file as part of the Record. 

The first of the various pleadings enumerated above is the Declaration, the general aspects of which 
will now be considered.

20. The first pleading in an Action is the plaintiff s Declaration, which is a statement in 
legal and methodical form, of all the material facts constituting the plaintiff’s cause of action. It consists of 


the following parts: 


(1) Caption or Title of Court

(ID The Venue 
(IIT) 
(IV) The Body, or Statement of the Cause 
of Action 
THE parties having been brought into Court as a result of the service of some Form of Process, the 
next step is to show, by Pleadings duly recorded, the nature of their dispute, and the first step in this 
direction in Personal Actions is for the plaintiff to file his Declaration, which is a statement in Legal Form 
of the plaintiff's Cause of Action. In the Ancient Real Actions the first Pleading was a Count The 
Declaration was, according to Coke, but an amplification of the General Charge contained in the Original 
Writ, setting forth in greater detail the circumstances involved in the plaintiff's Cause of Action. 
According to the custom and practice of the Court in which it was filed, and depending upon the Form of 
the Action in each Case, the substantive requisites of the Declaration differed. But all Declarations were 
alike in that they contained five formal parts, to wit, the Title of the Court, the Venue, the 
Commencement, the Body, or Statement of the Cause of Action, and the Conclusion, the character and 


relative posi

BODY: 


Arthur Brown, plaintiff, by William Jbhnson, his Attorney, complains of Clarence Dowell, defendant, who has been summoned to answer 
the said plaintiff in a plea of trespass on the case in assuiupsit. 

Inducement: For that whereas, on the 16th day of January, $.D. ~926, at Chicago, In the county aforesaid, the said plaintiff, at the request of 
the defendant, bargained with the said defendant to buy of him, and the said defendant then and there sold to the said 
plaintiff, a large quantity of corn, to wit, one thousand bushels at the price of sixty cents for each bushel thereof, to be 
delivered by the said defendant to the said plaintiff in the week then next following at the said plaintiff's elevator in said 
city, and to be paid for by the said plaintiff to the said defendant on the delivery thereof as aforesaid. 

And in consideration thereof and that the said plaintiff had promised the said defendant, at his request, to accept and receive the said corn, 
arid to pay him for the same at the price aforesaid, be, the said defendant, on the day first aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, promised the said 
plaintiff to deliver the said corn to him as aforesaid.

With the Form of a Specific Declaration in Assumpsit before us, the Declaration may now be examined, first, 
With reference to its formal parts and general compositional and physical structure, and secondly, with 
reference to the usual factors and rules which govern the statement of a cause of action in any form; the 
problem of stating a cause of action in terms of each of the eleven specific Common Law Actions will 
follow in later chapters. 


The Caption or Title of the Court and Term 

WITH respect to the Title of the Court, it consists, in general, of a superscription of the Name of the 
Court, thus, “In the Circuit Court of County.” With respect to the Entitlement of Term, it is either Gen- 
era], thus, “October Term, 1955,” or Special, that is where a particular day of the term is stated. Such Title 
refers to the time when

the party is supposed to deliver his Oral Allegation in Open Court; and as it was only in Term Time that 
the Court anciently sat to hear the pleading, it is therefore always of a Term that the pleadings are entitled, 
though they are often in fact filed or delivered in Vacation Time. The Term of which any pleading is entitled is 
usually that in which it is actually filed or delivered, or when this takes place in vacation, the Title is of the 
Term last preceding. 


The most frequent practice is to Entitle Generally. But it is to be observed that a pleading so entitled is by 


Page 94 of 735 


construction of the law presumed, unless proof be given to the contrary, to have been pleaded on the first day of 
the Term. And the effect of this is that, if a General Title is used, it will sometime occasion an apparent 
objection. Thus, in the case of a Declaration so Entitled, it may appear in the Declaration or in evidence 
on the Trial that the Cause of Action arose after the first day of the Term of which the Declaration is Entitled; 
and in either case this objection would arise: that the plaintiff would appear to have declared before his 
cause of action accrued, whereas the Cause of Action ought of course always to exist at the time the action is 
commenced.’ The means of avoiding this difficulty is to Entitle Specially of the particular day in the Term 
when the pleading was actually filed or delivered. 


The Venue* 
THE laying of Venue was inextricably connected with the various stages of the devel 


3. See English: Pugh v. Robinson, 1 T.R. 116, 99 Eug. Rep. 1004 (1786); New York: Paul v. Graves, 5 Wend. (N.Y.) 16 (1830). 
4. In general, on the subject of Venue in Common Law and Modern Actions, see: 


Treatises: flayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, c, II, Trial by Jury and Its Devilopment, 65, 90—93 (Boston 1898); 
Scott, Fundamental Principles of Procedure In Actions at 


opment of the Jury. In the first stage the Jury was not a Jury, but in reality a group of witnesses who came into 
Court, and on the basis of their own knowledge of the facts of the specific case, told the Judge what happened. 
In order, therefore, that the juror or jurors with knowledge of the facts might be selected, it was necessary for 
the sheriff to know where they could be located. The rule at Common Law, therefore, was that every material 
and traversable allegation of fact in the Body of the Declaration, if affirmative in form, should be laid with a 
Venue. Besides this Venue, which, by the ancient practice, included the parish, town or hamlet, as well as the 
county, there was another laid on the margin of the Declaration, at its Commencement, stating merely the name of 
the county. 


In the second stage of the development the Jury went partly on its own knowledge, and partly on knowledge 
gained from evidence presented in the Court. In consequence, the reasons upon which the original rule was 
founded gradually ceased to have any meaning. And as a result of the two statutes of 16 and 17 Car. U, c. 
8 (1664) and of 4 Anne, c. 16, § 6 (1705), the rule requiring the laying of Venue in the Body of the Plead- 


ing became an unmeaning form, the practice of alleging the Venue in the margin hay-

ing been found sufficient for all practical purposes.” But the practice continued to be observed 
nonetheless. 

In the meantime the Jury had reached its third. state of development in which jurors ceased to be 
witnesses and became triers of facts, going on knowledge furnished by the evidence heard in open Court. 


Page 95 of 735 


With this development, an end was brought to the former practice by the Rule of Hilary Term, 4 Wm. TV, 
(1834), which provided that in the future “the name of a county shall in all cases be stated in the margin 
of a Declaration 

.-and no Venue shall be stated in the Body of the Declaration.” 7 And presently, under the more recent 
practice, but in accordance with the spirit and intent of this Rule, the Venue is usually set out at the Com- 
mencement of the Declaration, as appears in the form above. 

However, in eases which required local de.scription, the Venue was still to be laid in the Body of the 
Declaration.” But the enforcement of this rule did not call for the statement of a correct Venue except when the 
Action was Local, and in Transitory Ac-tons the Venue could be laid in any county, subject to objection by 
the adverse party.° 


The Commencement 
WHAT is termed the Commencement of the Declaration precedes the Statement of the Cause of Action or 
Body of the Declaration.

It comprises the Parties, correctly named; 

the Mode in which the defendant has been brought into Court, Arrested, Served with Process, Attached or 

Summoned; the Capacity in which the parties sue and are sued, whether as an individual, as a corporation, 

or in a representative character as executor or receiver, or if an infant, by a guardian, or next friend; and 

the Form of Action, as, for example, Trespass on the Case in Assumpsit)0 


The Body or Statement of the Cause of Action 

THE Body of the Declaration is the most 
important part of it, for it is here that the plaintiff states the facts showing his cause of action. But what is a 
cause of action? Gould defined a cause of action as a set of “facts which entitles the plaintiff to the relief 
claimed.”” Of course the essential elements of any claim of relief or remedial right will vary from action 
to action. But, on analysis, the pleader will find that the facts prescribed by the substantive law as 
necessary to constitute a cause of action in a given case, may be classified under three heads: (1) The 
plaintiff’ s right or title; (2) The defendant’s wrongful act violating that right or title; (3) The consequent 
damage, whether nominal or substantial. And, of course, the facts constituting the cause of action should 
be stated with certainty and precision, and in their natural order, so as to disclose the three elements 
essential to every cause of action, to wit, the right, the wrongful act and the damages) 


The Conclusion 
THE Conclusion of a Declaration is the Formal Statement at the end, following the

It is, “to the plaintiff’s damage of ~ 
and therefore he brings his suit,” etc. This “ad damnum” clause is properly a part of the conclusion in all 
Personal and Mixed Actions. By the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852,13 a Specific Form of Conclusion was 
prescribed. 


The Production of Suit 

THE Production of the plaintiff's suit (secta), by which the plaintiff was required to present proof of his 
Declaration at once, and even before it was called into question upon the pleading, is an example of one of 
those instances, not infrequently noticeable in Common Law Pleading, where the form of an old procedure is 
retained, long after the reason for its existence has been swept away. Anciently, in the primitive period of Common 
Law Procedure when Pleadings were still made Orally, and Trial by Battle and Ordeal was still in vogue, the 
plaintiff was required to produce his proof, or his sect a— that is, a suite or train of followers prepared to confirm 
his Allegations. Although the practice has long been discontinued, the original formula there used to announce the 
plaintiff's readiness still remains with us. In consequence, in all Common Law Actions it is still customary to 
conclude the Declaration with the phrase “and thcrefore he brings his suit.” 14

the said goods or their value, and £ for their detention.”

(1714), 


It should be observed that the plaintiff brings, not 

this suit, but his suit, a following of witnesses. 2

At Common Law, according to Martin,” the signature of counsel was not required, and this rule was enacted into 
statutory form by the Common Law Procedure Act of 

1852.” 


THE ACTUAL STATEMENT OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION 


21. The Declaration must state distinctly and with certainty every fact that is essential to the plaintiff s prima 
facie case. No Essential Allegations can be imported into the Declaration by inference or intendment. The principal 
points to he shown in the statement of a cause of action are: 

(I) The plaintiff s right; 


(ID) The defendant’ s wrongful act violating that right; 


(III) The consequent damages.

THE term “cause of action” 17is much used in pleading and procedure, but it eludes

exact definition. "° Probably it is unsafe to define it more specifically than to say that the cause of is consists of 
some combination of facts or events, or some transaction from which a right to remedial relief arises. The typical 
elements or operative facts underlying these rights and which entitle the plaintiff to some form of remedy differ 
with the various kinds of actions, whether of contract, property or tort. At Common Law, therefore, the question as 
to whether a plaintiff had stated a good cause of action did not turn on the facts of a particular transaction, but on 
whether the plaintiff or his attorney had properly diagnosed the legal effect of the facts, or, to put the matter in 
another way, whether the Declaration stated a cause of action which fell within the theory of liability

Form of Action selected to vindicate an alleged legal right. 
The Declaration; A Legal Syllogism 


WITH this working definition in mind, we are now in a position to undertake the Framing of a Declaration in 
which a cause of action will be alleged. In this connection it should be remembered that a Declaration is a 
Syllogism with the Major Premise left out. What is meant by this? 20 It is this: since every liability consist of two 
elements—a given combination of facts and events, plus a rule of substantive law attaching legal consequences— 
it follows that a complete statement of the entire right of action would inelude both the combination of facts and the 
rule of substantive Jaw relied upon. If these two elements are established, Judgment for the plaintiff will be 
entered. Such Judgment naturally follows from certain premises of fact and of law, which may be stated as fol- 
lows: 


(1) 2’~fajor Premise: The rule of law relied upon by the plaintiff—by rule of the Substantive Law of real 
property, damages may be recovered against one who rides over my corn, or trespasses on my property: 


(2) Minor Premise: The combination of facts relied upon by the plaintiff—that the defendant has ridden over my 
corn; 


Conclusion: Therefore, the plaintiff right of action against defendant in he may recover damages against 
the

ID- “Every action is brought in order to obtain some particular result which is termed the remedy. This final result is not the “Cause of the Action:’ 
it is rather the ‘Object of the Action,’ Wildman v. Wildman, 70 Conn. 700, 707, 41 A. 1, 2 (1898). 


And a “Cause of Actioa” should be distinguished from an “Action”, the former consisting of the Facts which give rise to the Action, the 
latter being a Proceeding in Court. Ponaeroy, Code Remedies, e. III, ~ 347 (4th ed. by logic, Boston, 1904).

The Defendant’s Wrongful Act Violating That Right 

NO cause of action can arise unless some right of the plaintiff has been violated or injured by the defendant, 
The injury as well as the right must, therefore, be alleged in the Declaration. Thus, in an Action for the 
Breach of a Contract, it is not only necessary to show the existence of the contract, binding the defendant to 
perform or forbear some act for the plaintiff, but it is also necessary to show that the defendant has violated 
some duty arising from the contract; that is, that the performance of the contract became due, and that he 
failed to perform it. This appears from the Declaration given above. And, so likewise, in an Action of 
Trespass quare clauswn fregU the trespass by the defendant must be shown; and in an Action of Trover a 
showing of conversion by the defendant is essential. 


The Consequent Damages 


IT is not only necessary to show that the defendant has violated some right of the plaintiff, but it is also 
necessary to go further and show that the plaintiff has been damaged thereby, for injury without damage 
(“injurkz sine dantno”) does not give rise to a cause of action.” In most cases, 


person has obtained possession; or has the right as against all persons to the immediate physical Control of a chattel, if no other person is

where a wrong is shown, nominal damages may be recovered. The fact, however, that damage will be 
presumed in any given case, does not dispense with the necessity of an averment of damage in the Declaration. 


What is a Fact 
BUT when you have found that you must allege a right, a violation of that right and damages, as an incident 
of stating a cause of action, you have not as yet touched the problem as to what particular kind of facts 
must be alleged in order to properly plead these so-called essentials of a good cause of action, a matter to which 
we may now address ourselves. 


In order to frame a good declaration in which a good cause of action is stated, a pleader must consider first, 
what facts must be stated, and second, in what manner and form should such facts, whatever their character, 
be stated? 


And these inquiries raise the question as to what, then, is a fact. A fact may be said to be anything of which a 
past or present existence may be asserted. And, for purposes of legal analysis, there are ordinary facts and 
extraordinary facts of law, Ordinary facts may be separated into two groups, ultimate and evidentiary facts, 


Ultimate Fact Defined 


AN ultimate fact 23 is any fact to which the substantive law attaches legal conseLEd. 305 (1876); so also in a private 
action for a 
public nuisance, Swain & Son v. Chicago 13. & 0. It. Co., 252 IN. 622, 97 N.E. 247 (1911). 

And in Treusch v. Kamka, 83 Md. 274 (1885), where the Declaration alleged no Damages from negligence, it was held fatal on 
Demurrer. 


23- In general, on what facts must be ailei~ed nt Common Law and under modern codes and Practice Acts, see

quences. It sometimes may be inferred from the statement of a sufficiently large number of evidentiary facts. 
Thus, for example, if a plaintiff wants to institute an Action of Ejectment against a defendant, he must look to 
the Substantive Common Law governing real property to discover what Ailegations he must allege in his 
Declaration to state a good cause of action. There he discovers that he must allege Right or Title, 
Wrongful Act of Ejectment, and Damages. If, in drafting his Declaration, the plaintiff omits an Al— 
legation required by the Substantive Law, the defect is available on Demurrer at the Pleading Stage, on Motion 
in Arrest of Judgment, after Verdict and before Judgment, and on Writ of Error, after Final Judgment, under 
the general principle that ordinarily a Substantive Defect, or a failure to state a material, or ultimate fact is 
always available at any stage of the proceedings. 


Evidentiary Fact Defined 

AN evidentiary fact is a fact to which the Substantive Law does not attach legal consequences, but from 
which, if stated in sufficient detail, an ultimate fact may sometimes be inferred. Thus, to illustrate, in the 
Action of Ejectment referred to above, let us suppose that the plaintiff alleged, by way of title, that he had 
a “grant deed” of Black-acre. The Substantive Law of real property requires that in order for the plaintiff to state a 
good cause of action, he must allege that he owned, possessed, had an immediate right to possession, or was 
seized of Black-acre. As a “grant deed” of Blackacre is not title, but only evidence of title, the plaintiff’ s 
Declaration is defective in having stated an evidentiary fact, whereas he should have alleged the ultimate 
fact that he was “seized”

of Blackacre.°* Stating an evidentiary fact violates the Rule of Pleading that Ultimate Facts must be stated, and 
such violation creates a Defect in Form, which may be reached by Special Demurrer.” 


ULTIMATE AND EVIDENTIARY FACTS 
22. The Ultimate and Operative Facts should be pleaded, not Evidentiaty Facts and not Conclusions of 
Law. 


WITH these distinctions in mind, we are for the first time in a position to state the General Rule as to what facts 
must be stated in order to state a good cause of action. The General Common Law Rule is that the plaintiff, in order 
to state a good cause of action in his Declaration, must allege ultimate facts, and not evidentiary facts, and not 
Conclusions of Law)°

792, 796 (1897), where it was contended that the Declaration alleged Evideatiary as opposed to Ultimate Pacts, the CourtS in discussing the 
question as to whether stating Evidentiary Pacts was a defect in form or in substance, declared: “This latter conteation Is no doubt true, but 


as the Evidentiary Facts alleged are sufficient, if true, to establish conclusively the Ultimate Pacts, the defect In this respect is one of form, 
and not one of substance. If the Evidentiary Facts alleged were Insufficient in Law to Establish the Ultimate Facts, the defect would he one of 
substance, proper to be reached by General Demurrer; but if the objection be simply to this manner of Pleading the Ultimate Facts, tbe defect 


is one of form, and could formerly be reached by Special Demurrer only.” 


See, also, on Evidentiary Facts, DeCordova v. San viille, 165 App.Div. 128, 150 N.Y.Supp. 709 (1914), reversed in 214 N.Y. 662, 108 N.E. 1092 
(1915). 


20.“The only question, then, Is whether the Complaints, all of which are in substance as above stated, contain what is technically a Sufficient 
Statement of a Cause of Action. The Sufficiency of the Pleadings Is to be determined by the New York Code of Procedure. This requires a 
‘plain and concise Statement of the Facts constituting a Cause of Action,’ Section 43t But the Rule of Pleading at Common Law was the same, 
viz., that Facts, not mere Conclusions of Law, were to be stated. I Chit P1, 214; Allen v. Patterson, 7 N.Y. 478.” Brown, 3.. In Muser

The process of differentiating, in the confused history of a case, the Ultimate or Om erative Facts from 
the probative and collateral circumstances involved, is the first step in the diagnosis of the case, to discover 
whether the plaintiff has a right of action, and also for the intelligent statement of the cause of action in the 
Declaration. Only the essential facts should be alleged which form the basis of the claim for relief. This excludes 
the details and particulars of evidence by which these fundamental points are to be established. Some 
observance of this distinction is necessary if the pleadings are to make the issues clear, simple and certain. The 
subordinate facts, which make up the probative matter, the casual details and dramatic circumstances, may vary 
indefinitely, but the “Ultimate”, the “Material” or “Issuable” Facts cannot be omitted without destroying 
the plaintiffs cause of action or the defendant’s Defense, as the case may be. 


As observed earlier, it is a well-settled Rule of Pleading that it is never necessary to set forth mere 
Matters of Evidence.” In other

The rule under consideration is not noticed in Equity Pleading strictly, It being there often essential that the Facts which are the 
Subject of the Action, be stated in detail. Story, Commentaries on Equity Pleading, c. V ~ 265a, n. 1 (9th S. by Gould, Boston, 
1879). 

But in Code Pleading the Rule is fully recognized. though not expressly prescribed; and, as the Codes retain but one form of action for both legal 
and non-legal remedies, the application of the Rule Is 


words, although a particular fact may be of the essence of a party’s cause of Action or Defense, so that a 
statement of it is indispensable, it still is not necessary, in alleging it, to state such circumstances as merely tend to 
prove the tnath of the fact. 


The reason of the rule is evident, if we revert to the general object which all the rules, tending to certainty, 
contemplate, that is, the attainment of a certain issue. This implies, as has been shown, a development of the 
question in controversy in a specific shape; but so that that object be attained, there is, in general, no 
necessity for further minuteness in the pleading; and therefore, those subordinate facts, which go to make 
up the evidence by which the affirmative or negative of the issue is to be established, are not required to 
be alleged, and hence may be brought forward for the first time at the Trial, when the issue comes to be decided. 


The Ultimate or Operative Facts are the Facts required by the Substantive Law; it is these Facts which the 
party needs to establish to win his case) They must be facts, definite and concrete enough to direct atten- 
tion fo the basis or ground of the plaintiff s legal contentions. But at the same time, they must reduce the 
case to its essentials. For instance, if the pleader wishes to allege that the railroad contracted to carry the 
plaintiff as a passenger on its train with his 


sometimes difficult. See Bliss, Law of Pleading Under the Codes of Civil Procedure, e. XIII, Rules Governing the Statement, Rule V, 
Evidence Should Not be Pleaded, 323, 324 (34 ed. St. Paul 1894). 


25. “For the Purpose of Pleading only the ‘Ultimate Fact to be proved need be stated. The circumstances whith tend to prove the Ultimate Fact 
can be used for Purposes of Evidence, but they have no place in the Pleadings.” McAllister v. Kuhn, 90 U. 8. 87, 24 L.Ed. 615 (1877). See 
also, Steuben County Bank v. Mathewson, 5 Hill (Ni.) 249 (1843), 


It is the office of a pleading to allege the ultimate facts. Hence, a Deelaratlon that defendant negligently allowed a fire to start on his own 
premises need not describe the start of the fire or other circumstance of its origin. Mabaffey v. 3. Ia. RumS barger Lumber Co., 71 W.Va. 175, 
76 S.E. 182 (1912). 


baggage, he should not go into an historical narrative of how the defendant went to the window and the 
agent sold the plaintiff a ticket and who checked his trunk, If the pleader wishes to allege that a certain 
deed was not recorded he should not allege that he searched in the proper office in vain and failed to find 
the record, as this would create an immaterial issue. And if the plaintiff wishes to set up that he is the 
owner of certain land, he should i-iot set forth the links in his chain of title, for, as we have seen, this is 
evidentiary matter; he should allege that he is seized of the land in question, as seisin is the Ultimate or 
Material Fact to which the law of real property attaches the legal consequences of ownership, which the plain- 
tiff is seeking to establish against the defenthnt.

An Allegation that a municipal corporation “became entitled” to divert water from a river is a Conclusion of Law. It depends for its soundness

and the existence of a legal duty or obligation are often mere Conclusions. A statement that the 
defendant is indebted to the 
plaintiff in a certain sum gives no facts to charge the defendant. In Common-Law Pleading, it is permitted 
under the Common Counts to state this Conclusion of Indebtedness, but it is accompanied by some general 
statement of the ground of the debt. In referring to this tendency toward generality in Pleading, David 
Dudley Field said of the Common Counts: “They (the Courts and the Lawyers) made the rules and they 
defend them, as a means of eliciting the precise point of fact in dispute between the parties; and they contrive 
every means in their power to conceal it, under forms the most general and unmeaning that can be imagined.” 
a Instead of stating the concrete facts of the claim, a Common Count states only Conclusions of Law, the mere 
Averment that the defendant is indebted for this or that. This does not disclose the real nature of the liability, or 


Page 104 of 735 


assist in analyzing and presenting the Issues of Law and Fact upon which the indebtedness depends. 


The General Issues at Common Law are usually denials of Legal Conclusions instead of Denials of the 
Facts from which the liability is inferred; e.g. nil debet, or Not Indebted. 


It is not always easy to distinguish the details of evidence, on the one hand, and Conclusions of Law, on the 


other, from the OPerative or Issuable Facts, upon which the right to relief depends. It is often a matter 


reetly sustained. Camp & Bros. v. Hall, 39 FIt 533, 568, 22 So. 792, 796 (1897). See, also, Winhelm V. Fleld, 107 IILApp. 145, 161

32.In Lefkovitz V. City of Chicago, 238 IIL 23, 87 N. B. 58 (1909), it was held that Averments by the plaintiff that obstructions were

of degree.” While the pleading must have certainty and particularity in the Averment of Facts, a General 
Mode of Pleading is often sufficient as to certain matters, and no greater particularity is reguired than the nature 
of the sort of thing described will conveniently admit of. “The Rules of Pleading determining whether 
Allegations must be Generic or Specific—and, if the latter, to what degree—are, like other Rules of Law, 
based on considerations of policy and convenience. Thus, the facts constituting fraud, are frequently 
required to be alleged in comparatively detailed form,” ~ 


In many situations a single convenient term is employed to designate (generically) 
certain miscellaneous Operative Facts, such 
as ownership or possession, which is a method of stating their net force and effect in law, without alleging the 
specific circumstances. It is sufficient to allege that the plaintiff is the owner of certain land or that he was 
possessed of certain chattels.*° On the other hand, it would be a Conclusion of

A Statement of an Ultimate Fact In Pleading is not objectionable as a Conclusion of Law, as an “Ultimate Fact” is necessarily a conclusion 
from inter’ mediate and evidentiary facts. Williams v. Peninsula Grocery Co., 73 Fla. 937, 75 So. 517 (1917).

SEVERAL COUNTS IN THE 
SAME DECLARATION 


24. A Count is a separate and independent statement of the material facts constituting a Cause of Action. A 
Declaration may include several Counts, each Count, in such a case, being regarded as a Separate 
Declaration. Several Counts may be either of one or two descriptions: 

or 
(1) Statements of distinct causes of action, 


(2) Different statements of the same cause 

of action. 
ACCORDING to Keigwin, “Duplicity, or 
Double Pleading, is the stating in support of

The term “facts”, “must include many Allegations which are Mixed Conclusions of Law and Statements of Fact; otherwise Pleadings would 
become intolerably prolix.” Mitchell, 1, in C., C. & St. L. By. Co. v. Nichols, Ind.App.) 130 N.E. 546 (1921)- 

In an action for negligent Injury, negligence being the Ultimate Pact to be Pleaded, and not mere Conclusions of Law, a declaration or petition 
charging defendants with an act injurious to plaintiff, with a General Allegation of Negligence, is sufficient, as against a General Demurrer, 
without setting forth the details of the acts causing the injury, unless they could not be negligent under any circumstances. Tatum v- Louisville 
& N. Il. (Jo., 253 F. 898, 165 C.C.A. 378 (1918); Freidman v. Denhalter Bottling Co., 54 Utah 513, 182 P. 843 (1919); Louis v. Smith-

. A plea of contributory nogligence is not sufficient if it merely states a Conclusion of Law, but must Aver the Facts constituting the 
negligence, which must be such that the Conclusion of Negligence follows as Matter of Law, Dwight Mfg. Co. v, Holmes, 198 Ala. 590, 73

the same Demand or the same Defence two or more grounds of which either is sufficient for the purpose. 


“Thus, for a single piece of work the person liable may at one time promise to pay a certain price and on 
another occasion promise to pay whatever the work is worth. Since either promise is sufficient to sustain a demand 
of payment, to allege both would be Double Pleading. So one sued for money may have several Defenses, 
such a Payment, Want or Failure of Consideration, the Statute of Limitations, a Discharge in Bankruptcy; and 
one who is sued for nonperformance of something to be done upon request might defend by showing that he was 
never requested and never refused to perform. In either of these cases, to set up in Defence more than one of the 
facts available to defeat the suit would constitute Duplicity.” 42 


As the Common Law scheme of remedial ruling was designed to produce a single issue, the 
determination of which would settle the litigation, Duplicity was regarded as a vice as it conduced to the 
Multiplication of Issues. Each cause of action and each Defence was required to be placed on one ground, which 
on Traverse or Plea in Confession and Avoidance would leave only a single point in issue at any one stage of 
the pleading, and then ultimately develop a single clear-cut Issue of Fact. Double Pleading was therefore 
prohibited to prevent a party arguing two or more matters from which a plurality of issues might develop. 
With this preliminary statement in mind, we may now 
consider the problem presented when Several Counts are placed in the same Declaration, a form of which 
appears below:

SHIPMAN, Handbook of Common Law Pleading, c. X, 206 (3rd ed. by Ballantine, St. Paul, 1923). 

Where a party had several distinct causes of action, at Common Law, he was allowed to pursue them 
cumulatively in the same action, subject to several rules, to be presently explained, as to joining such 
demands only as were of similar character or quality. Thus, he might join a claim of Debt on a Bond with a claim 


of Debt on a Simple Contract, and pursue his remedy for both in the same Action of Debt.” So, if several 
distinct trespasses were committed, these might all form the subject of one Action in Trespass.” 


43. Trth,,~ Cotton Manufactory v. Lobdell, 13 Johns, (N.Y.) 482 (1810), in which the Court introduced the foliowlag test: “The Rule is 


Page 107 of 735 


invariable, that Causes of Action, which admit of the Same Plea and the Same Judgment, may be Joined; but the ecaverse of this 
proposition is not invariably truo.” 


44- That different Acts of Negligence may be charged In different Counts as the Cause of Injury, see Scott 
1 


Where the plaintiff thus makes several demands in the same action, he should set them out separately in his 
Declaration in what are called “Separate Counts.” Each Count is a separate, independent statement of a cause of 
action. 


Moreover, a plaintiff is permitted to state the same cause of action in different ways in different Counts, as 
if he were setting out so many separate and distinct causes of action. This was for the purpose of pre- 
venting the defeat of a just cause of action through an incidental Variance between the 
evidence produced at the Trial and the Allegations contained in the various Counts. In an effort to avoid 
such an occurrence, the same cause of action was stated in different Counts so as to meet any variation in the 
evidence which might develop at the Trial. 


The use of Several Counts was subject to 
the requirement that each Count must be 
eas complete and distinct in itself as if pleaded alone. The sufficiency of one of Several Counts was 
determined on its own Averments, without regard to the other Counts.’ One Count, however, might make 
reference to another for relevant matter without the necessity of repeating it. 


The use of Several Counts when applied to distinct causes of action was entirely consistent with the 
Rule Against Duplicity, as the object of that rule was to prevent several issues in respect to the same 
demand only, there being no objection to having several issues where the demands were several.

Where Several Counts were thus used, the defendant might, according to the nature of his Defense, 
Demur to the entire Declaration, or plead a single Plea to the entire 
Declaration, or he might follow the course of Demurring to one Count and pleading to another, or he 
might plead a Separate Plea to each Count; and in the two latter cases the action may cause a corres- 
ponding severance in the subsequent pleading, and the production of several issues. But, whether one or 
more issues be produced, if the decision, whether on Law or Fact, was in the plaintiff's favor, as to any 
one or more Counts, he was entitled to Judgment pro tanto, even though he failed as to the remainder.”

According to Professor Edson 11. SunderJand, Misjoinder of Causes of Action was at Common Law, without good reason, regarded as a 


most serious error. See article, Joinder of Actions, 18 Mich.L.itcv. 571, 574 (1920). 
But some actions of different forms, such as Debt and Detinue, Case and Trover, could be joined. Misjoinder might result from the diversity of 
capacities in which the parties sued or were sued.

Trespass with Case,” as they 
Were actions of different natures; and, for the same reason, it was not possible to join Trespass or Case 
with Detinue or Replevin. 


Neither can Causes of action due in different rights be joined.” In referring to this very point, Professor 
Edam R. Sunderland said: “Thus a Count on behalf of two plaintiffs jointly could not be joined with a 
Count on behalf of one of them severally; Counts could not be joined each of which set up a several right 
in a different plaintiff against the same defendant; Counts setting up different causes of action in favor of 
the same plaintiff against different defendants could not be joined; and Counts alleging the joint liability 
of two or more defendants could not be joined with Counts alleging the several liability of any or all of 
them.” oo

DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME 
CAUSE OF ACTION 


26. Facts constituting but a single cause of action may be differently stated in Separate Counts, in the 
same Declaration, without flu. plicity. 


THE Rule here stated is the result of an ancient relaxation of the Rule against Duplicity, allowed where 
the nature of the facts upon which the plaintiff's claim rests rendered it doubtful whether a single 
statement might not fall to justify a recovery, either from insufficiency in Law, or inability to properly 
support the claim by competent 
proof. The pleader is therefore permitted to include in his Declaration several statements of the same Cause of Action, 
each of which differently represents the same State of Facts, and upon one of which a Verdict may be obtained, 
though he fail as to the rest. He may thus insert as many Counts or Statements as he pleases, though there can be 
but one recovery of the sum claimed as due. 

This Rule, says Stephen, is a relaxation of very ancient date, and has long since passed, by continual 
sufferance, into allowable and regular practice. It takes place when the pleader, in drawing the 
Declaration in Any Action, after having set forth his case in one view, feels doubtful whether, as so stated, 
it may not be insufficient in Point of Law, or incapable of proof in Point of Fact, and at the same time 
perceives another Mode of Statement by which the apprehended difficulty may probably be avoided. Not 
choosing to rely on either view of the case exclusively, he takes the course of adopting both, and 
accordingly inserts the second form of statement, in the shape of a second Count, in the same manner as if 
he were proceeding for a separate Cause of Action. If, upon the same principle, he wishes to vary still 
further the Method of Allegation, he may find it necessary to add many other succeeding Counts besides 
the second; and thus, in practice, a great Variety of Counts often occurs 
Sec. 26 

DIFFERENT VERSIONS 

99 

in respect of the same Cause of Action, the Law not having set any limits to the discretion of the Pleader, in 
This respect, if fairly and rationally exercised.’ 


Resort may be had to Several Counts in respect of the same Cause of Action, either where the State of 
Facts to which each Count refers is really different, or where the same State of Facts is differently 
represented. 


The first case may be illustrated by an Action of Debt on a Penal Bond whereby the defendant engaged 
to pay a certain penalty in the event of nonpayment of a sum of money on the 11th of June, and another 
sum on the 10th of July, and a certain sum every month after, till a certain sum was satisfied. Let it be 
supposed that the plaintiff complains of a failure in payment both on the 11th of June and 10th of July. 
Either failure entitles him to the penal sum for which he brings the action; but, if he states them both in 
the same Count, the Declaration will be double, The case, however, may be such as to make it convenient 
to rely on both defaults; for there may be a doubt whether one or other of the payments were not made,

Tyler, Washington, D. C. 1892); Ward v. Bell, 2 DoWI. 76 (1833) (The Judge in the Trial Court compared different counts to safety 
valves); Newby v. Mason, 1 Dowl. & Ryland 508 (1822). See, also, Keigwin, Precedents in Pleading, Case xvii, 425—428 (Washington, 


Page 111 of 735 


1910); Jackson v. Baker, 24 App.D.C. 100 (1904). “The Multiplication of Counts has long been consid. ered one of the chief abuses in the 
System of pleading. ..To allow the plaintiff or defendant to state his case in ten or fifteen different ways is a custom the reasonableness of 
which is not readily perceived.” The principal reason is the Strictness of the Rules as to Varlanee. Report of the Common Law 
Commissioners. On the “Licensed Duplicity of 

Plural counts” to meet (1) the uncertainties of evidence in support of the plaintiff’s case; (2) to meet doubt as to the Law; (3) to obtain for 
the plaintiff the greatest possible latitude of proof. Note in Keigwin, Precedents of PleadIng, 424, 426ff. A Count not varying substantially 
from a preceding Count Is objectionable for redundancy. Sowter v. seekonk Lace Ce., 34 Ri. 304, 83 A. 437 (1912). 


though it may be certain that there was at 

least one default; and if, under these circumstances, the plaintiff should set forth one of the defaults, and 
the defendant should take issue upon it, he might defeat the action by proving payment on the day alleged, 
though he would have been unable to prove the other payment. To meet this difficulty, the pleader might 
resort to two Counts. The first of these would set forth the penal bond, alleging a default of payment on the 
11th of June; the second would again set forth the same bond, describing it as “a certain other bond,” etc., 
and would allege a default on the 10th of July. The effect of this would be that the plaintiff, at the Trial, 
might rely on either default, as he might then find convenient. In this instance, the Several Counts are each 
founded on a different State of Facts, that is, a different default in payment, though in support of the same 
demand. 


But it more frequently happens that it is the same State of Facts differently represented which forms the 
subject of different Counts. Thus, where a man has ordered goods of another, and an action is brought 
against him for the price, the circumstances may be conceived to be such as to raise a doubt whether the 
transaction ought to be described as one of goods sold and delivered, or of work and labor done, and, in 
this case, there would be two Counts, setting forth the claim both ways, in order to secure a Verdict, at all 
events, upon one of them. The best illustration of the practice of thus restating a Cause of Action in the 
same Declaration is found in the use of the Common Counts in General Assumpsit, which appear in the 
chapter on the Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit. They eii~brace not only what are called the “Money 
Counts,” or those for money transactions, but also include Counts for almost any State of Facts upon 
which a debt may be founded. The Money Counts are those generally for money lent to the defendant, had 
and received by him for the pla’ mtiff,

or paid out for him by the latter, for interest due, and for an account “stated” or agreed upon. The others 
may be, among other things, for work and labor, goods sold and delivered, use and occupation, etc. And 
first of all, preceding the Common Counts, there may be a Special Count declaring on an express contract. 
This is done because it often happens that, when the Special Counts are found incapable of proof at the Trial, 
the Cause of Action will resolve itself into one of these general pecuniary forms of demand, and thus the 
plaintiff may obtain a Verdict on one of these Money Counts, though he fail as to all the rest. 


Again, the same State of Facts may be 
varied by omitting in one Count some matter stated in another. In such a ease the More Special Count is used, lest 


the omission of this matter should render the other Insufficient in Point of Law. The More General Count is 
adopted, because, if good in Point of Law, it will relieve the plaintiff from the necessity of proving such omitted 
matter in Point of Fact. If the defendant Demurs to the latter Count as insufficient, and takes Issue in Fact 
on the former, the plaintiff has the chance of proving the matter alleged, and also the chance of succeeding 
on the Demurrer. 


It is to be observed that, whether the 
subjects of Several Counts be really distinct or identical, they must always purport to be founded on distinct 
Causes of Action, and not to refer to the same matter; and this is effected by the insertion of such words as 
“other,” “the further sum”, etc. This is evidently rendered necessary by The Rule against Duplicity, which, 
though evaded, as to The Declaration, by The use of Several Counts, in the manner here described, is not to be 
directly vlolated.~

27. The Declaration must correspelul with the Writ or Process. The formal statement of the Cause of Action 
must correspond with all the material statements in the Process by which the action is commenced, or the deviation 
will constitute a Variance. 


IT was a rule of great antiquity that the Declaration must Conform to the Original Writ, and, though the 
Original Writ is no longer in use, the Rule is to be regarded as still in force, in its effect, in such of the United 


States as follow the Methods of Pleading at Common Law, as to the Process now generally in use for commencing an 
Action 


in the place of the Original Writ. A convincing proof of its force at the present day is that even in Code 
Pleading, though some writers claim that the principles applicable are derived entirely from the Practice 
Act itself, and not from the Common Law, the agreement between the Summons and Complaint in most 
of the particulars hereafter mentioned is essential, and for the same reason. Under the Rule, it may be 
taken as still requisite that the Declaration must correspond with the Process In the following respects: (1) 
As to the Names of Parties to the Action,” though when the Process describes the defendant by a wrong 
name, and he appears in his right one, he may be declared against by the latter;” (2) As to the number of 
parties, for it would not be allowable to Commence an Action in the name of one, and Frame the 
Declaration—an intermediate step—in the names of several;” 

(3) As to the character in which the parties sue or are sued. If the action is brought by the plaintiff in a 
representative capacity,

as an executor, the plaintiff cannot declare in his own right, though, if he styles himself executor simply, 
without showing that he sues as such, he may declare in his own right, the demand being still the same.” 
(4) As to the Cause of Action, both as to its form and the extent of the demand.” (5) As to time, it being 
essential that no material fact be stated in the Declaration as happening after the date or teste of the 
Process,” which is generally considered as the time of the Commencement of the Action.”

The consequences of a Variance between the Declaration and Process were generally serious at Common 
Law, though the strictness formerly prevailing has been considerably relaxed. The fault may be generally 
taken advantage of by Plea in Abatement,” except where modified rules have been adopted in different 
states, though a Variance a~ to the Cause of Action is ground for setting aside the Proceedings as 
irregular.

LAYING TRE VENUE 


28. In all Pleadings, some certain pJace must be alleged for every affirmative Traversable Fact, which place is 
called the ‘Venue” of the action. The Venue in all actions is to be laid truly, or at the option of the pleader, 
according as the same are respectively: 

(D Local, or 
(ID Transitory 
WITH each stage in the development of 
the Jury, the manner of laying Venue underwent a change. During the first or earliest 
stage, the general rule was that each affirmative Traversable Allegation in the Original Writ, arid also in the 
Declaration, which was required to Conform to the Writ in this as in other particulars, was to be laid with 
a Venue or place comprising, not only the county, but the specific place in the county in which the fact 


Page 114 of 735 


occurred. The rule also applied to actions Commenced by Bill instead of by Original Writ. And in both eases 
the Plea, Replication and Subsequent Pleadings were required to lay Venue to 
102 

Sec. 29 


each affirmative Traversable Allegation.‘ This laying of the Venue in connection with each Traversable 
Allegation in the Body of the Declaration or other pleading is designated as the Fact Venue. 


In the second stage of the Jury’s growth, and after the statute of 1705,2 the Jury was summoned from 
the county in which the action was triable, whether or not the fact in issue occurred there. The statute of 16 
& 17 Car. II, enacted in 1664,~ provided that 
a Judgment after Verdict should not be stayed or reversed on account of the Venue, if the cause were tried by a Jury 
of the county where the action was laid. According to Stephen, the practice of laying a Venue in the Body of 
the Pleadings became “an unmeaning form,” the Venue in the margin having been long found sufficient 
for all practical purposes.” ~ And by the Hilary Rules of 1834,° it was provided that “The name of a county 
shall in all cases be stated in the margin of a Declaration; and shall be taken to be the Venue intended by the 
plaintiff, and no Venue shall be stated in the Body of the Declaration, or in any Subsequent Pleading. 
Provided, that in cases where local description is now required, such local description shall be given.” 


A Venue should be laid in the Declaration, but failure to lay any Venue in a Transitory Action is regarded 
merely as a formal defect, which can only be taken advantage of by

Special Demurrer. In Massachusetts it was held that a Declaration in a Transitory Action, without a Venue, 
or with a wrong one, is bad in form if Specially Demurred to for this cause; but that objection cannot be 
taken in any other way.’ In most states it is not considered necessary, as formerly, in a Transitory Action, 
to lay every Traversable Fact affirmatively alleged with a Venue. It is sufficient if the name of the county 
appear in the margin, though it may not be alleged at all in the Body of the Declaration.” 


LOCAL AND TRANSITORY ACTIONS” 
29. A Local Action is one where the transaction upon which it is founded could only occur in a particular 
place, and may be either for: 
(D) The recovery of land; or 
(II) The establishment or maintenance of a right arising out of land, or the recovery of damages for its 
injury. 
Transitory Actions are those founded on transactions which might have taken place anywhere. 


THE law distinguishes between transactions which might occur at any place and

those which must occur at some certain place. Causes of action which do not necessarily arise in any specific 
place are Transitory, and may be brought in any jurisdiction in which the plaintiff succeeds in serving the 
defendant personally.’° Causes of action which necessarily involve a certain locality, such, for example, as 
an Action of Ejectment, are Local, and must be tried in the place where property involved is located. The 
distinction between Actions which are Local and hence must be brought in the jurisdiction where the 
property concerned is located, and Actions which are Transitory, and hence may be brought in any place 
where jurisdiction of the defendant may be obtained, is one which exerts an influence upon the laying of 


the Venue. 


Local Actions, therefore, embrace all those brought for the recovery of the seisin or possession of lands 
and tenements, which are purely local subjects, as an Action of Ejectment. An Action for Injury to real estate as 


: 11 : 2 13 :

action for obstructing a highway, is Local. In some states, however, Trespass may be maintained for injury 


Page 116 of 735 


to land located in a foreign jurisdiction.'* Thus, in New York, an express statutory enactment ‘s authorized 
Actions for Trespass to realty lying outside the State, and this Statute was subsequently construed in Jacobus v. Colgate. 2 


In the famous case of Mostyn v. Fabrigas,” Lord Mansfield, by way of dictum, took the view that 
Actions in Personam, including such actions as Trespass to the land, should be declared Transitory and 
not Local. The same view had been expressed by the same Judge in two earlier cases at Nisi Prius, but 
they were subsequently repudiated in Shelling v. Farmer” and Doulson v. Matthews.’ 

However this may be, where the Action is admittedly Local, the place where the land is situated must 
be truly stated. If it be misstated, there will be a fatal Variance between the Pleading and the Proof, place 
being here material as a matter of properly describing the subject matter of the action. The reason of the 
rule as to all Local Actions is that, as no Court has Jurisdiction over

15. Section 982a of the New York Code of Civil Procedure, adopted as Section 536 of the New York Real Property Law, provides: “An 
action may ho maintained in the Courts of this State to recover damages for injuries to real estate situate without the state, or for Breach of 
Contracts or of Cove’ nants relating thereto, whenever such an action could be maintained in relation to personal property without the 
state. The action must be tried in the county In which the parties or some one thereof re~ sides, or If no party resides within the state, In 
any county.”

The following Actions are Local, and within this rule: 

Ejeetment, Doulson v. Matthews, 4 T.R. 503, 100 Eng.Rep. 1143 (1792); Trespass or Trespass on the Case for injuries to real property, as for

contract between the parties on which the action is grounded. Warren v. Webb, 1 Taunt, 379, 127 Eng.Rep. 880 (1808). 


In an Action of Debt on a Judgment of a Court of Record, the Venue must be laid in the county whore the Record is located. I Chitty, on 
Pleading, c. IV, Of the Declaration, 281 (Philadelphia 1819); Barnes v. Kenyon, 2 Johns.Cas. (N.Y.) 381 (1801); Smith v, Clark, 1 Ark. 63 
(1838); but this is not the general rule under the Codes. 

At Common Law Replevin was purely a Local Action, as Non Cepit denied the taking at the place mentioned in the Declaration, to wit, on the 
land of the tenant, but the Action has been made Transitory by Statute In some states. 


Trespass to Realty is Local, not Transitory, anti cannot be brought in another state than where the land is situated, unless authorized by Statute.

Generally speaking, all actions which are called “personal,” whether they sound in Tort,” or 
Contract,” are Transitory in their nature, since the facts from which they arise may be supposed to have 
happened anywhere, and, in contemplation of Law’, have no natural locality. Place is, therefore, not material, and the 
Venue may be laid in any county, even though the cause of action arose within a Foreign Jurisdiction.” 

In some cases the Venue must be laid truly; in others this is not necessary, but

for nonpayment of rent, etc., whether the Action is Transitory or not depends upon whether it is founded upon privity of contract. If based 
upon privity of estate, as where the action is brought by the lessor or his personal representatives, or by the grantee of the reversion against the 
assignee of the lessee, it is Local. See White v. Sanborn, 6 N.H. 220 (1833); Clarkson v. Gifford, 1 Caincs (N.Y.) 5 (1803). Cf. New York 
Corporation v. Dawson, 2 Johns.Cas, 335 (1801).

p. 
it may be laid at the option of the pleader, This depends, as we shall now see, on the question whether the 
action is Local or Transitory. And in this connection two situations will be considered: 


(1) Where the facts are of a Transitory character, that is, not associated with any partkcular locality, the facts 
may be stated as having occurred at one place and proved as occurring at any other. In other words the Venue does 
not have to be stated truly, as was the case where the jurors were Selected because of their own peculiar knowl- 
edge of the facts in issue. In practice, however, it was always the better part of wisdom to Jay the Venue 
truly. But a Variance in respect to a Transitory Fact, unless it involved a matter of description,” would not prove 
fatal. Thus, if A alleged that B assaulted him at a certain place, he might support his Allegation by Proof that the 
assault took place at any other place. And the defendant, in his Plea, was ordinarily required to follow the 
Venue of the Declaration and could not specify another place for his Defense, even if that other place accorded 
with the truth.” But when the Defense depended for its validity upon its locality, and the place where it 
arose was not in accord with the place laid in the Declaration, the defendant might state the actual place, 
where he could justify by way of a plea of special traverse.”° 


(2) Where the cause of action was of a local nature, that is, where it concerned land, an action could not 


be supported in a jurisdiction which did not include the subject matter—the land. Thus, for example, if A 
brought an Action of Ejectment in county X

against B for land described as located in county F, the action would fail; in other words the defect would be 
available on Demurrer to the Declaration. And if the land were untruly described as being in county X, when the fact 
appeared in Proof at the Trial that the land was located in another county, the action would be dismissed. 
And the same was true where the action was brought for a trespass upon land which was in fact located in a 
foreign state.” 


Laying the Venue Under a Vidilicet 

Since place was not material in Transitory Actions, and the Venue could be laid in any county, even though the 
cause of action arose within a foreign jurisdiction, a remedy was thus afforded, not only in one state or county, for an 
injury to personal property within the limits of another, or without the limits of the United States, but also for the 
Breach of any Contract, wherever executed, anti even where relating to land.*~ When the Cause of Action and 
the Action itself were thus Transitory in their character, the plaintiff, in laying the Venue, was permitted to 
depart as widely from the fact as he thought fit and as was necessary to give the court in which he sued 
jurisdiction, without causing a discrepancy between the Allegations in the Declaration and the proof at the trial. The 
usual way of accomplishing this was by stating truly the facts constituting the cause of action as occurring at the place 
where it really happened, and then laying the Venue under a videlicet, as within the jurisdiction of the court; thus it might 
be alleged that the deed was dated “at Fort St. George in the East Indies, to wit, at Westminster in the County of 
Middlesex,” 29 or that the

trespass was committed in “Allegheny County in Maryland, to wit (scilicet) in the county of Washington in the 
District of Columbia.” This fictitious device was still in use in England in the early part of the Nineteenth Century, 
and was used in the United States as late as 189S.~° But, according to Keigwin,” it “is now used only by 
exceptionally careful pleaders.” 


LOCAL FACTS—VENUE IN PLEADINGS SUBSEQUENT TO TEE DECLARATION 


30. Local Facts must always be truly laid, both in the Declaration and Subsequent Pleadings, whether the 
Action be Local or Transitory. And in Transitory Actions, where the defendant pleads Transitory matters, the 
Venue must follow the Declaration, unless his Defense requfres a different statement. 


IT has been seen that in all Local Actions it is necessary to Aver all material facts as happening where they 
actually occurred, and the same is equally true as to the Allegation of all Local Facts in both the .Declaration and 
Subsequent Pleadings, whether the Action be Local or Transitory. But in actions of the latter kind, where the 
Subsequent Pleadings ailege only matters Transitory in their nature, it is a rule that the Place of Trial laid in the 
Declaration draws to itself the Trial of all such matters.” The defendant, therefore, in such cases, is obliged to follow 
the Venue that the plaintiff has laid, unless his Defense requires the Allegation of a different place; for, if allowed to 
deviate from this, without the necessity arising from a Defense founded upon Local Facts, he would be able to 
change or oust the Venue in Transitory Actions, and thus to subvert the rule allowing the plaintiff in such 
actions

to bring his suit, and consequently to lay 

his Venue, in any county he pleases. It would seem that the necessity of laying any Venue at all in proceedings 
subsequent to the Declaration would be obviated by this rule, and it has been so held; ~ but in practice it is still 
usual to lay a Venue in these as well as in the Declaration, and, in point of form, is the proper course. 


CONSEQUENCES OF MISTAKE 
OR OMISSION 


31. A mistake or omission in laying the Venue may be taken advantage of— 
(1) By Demurrer, where the defect is apparent on the Face of the Declaration 


(ID By Plea in Bar or Motion for Non-suit, where it is not. 

BY the ancient rule of the Common Law, 
a mistake in laying the Venue for Local Matters was ground for Nonsuit, by reason of 
misdescription of the subject matter of the suit,“ and its omission, when necessary, an incurable defect,” But since the 
establishment of the distinction between Local and Transitory Actions, if the fault appears on the face of the 
Declaration, it will be good cause for Special Demurrer; - and, if it does not so appear, it may be Pleaded in Bar of 
the Action, or taken advantage of at the 
Trial, by Motion for a Nonsuit on the ground of Variance.’ And in Transitory Actions, also, an omission of the Venue, if 
not Demurred to, may be aided by any Plea which admits the fact for the Trial of which a prop-

er Venue should have been laid,” or by a Judgment by Default,” or by verdict; - but even in Transitory Actions, 
as it is necessary that some Venue be laid, the omission remains fatal on Demurrer. 


TIME” 


32. In Personal Actions, the pleadings must allege the time—that is, the day, month and year—when each 
Traversable Fact occurred; and when a continuing act is mentioned, its 4uration should he shown. 


IT is a general rule of pleading in Personal Actions that the necessity of laying a time, like that of laying a Venue, 
extends to every Traversable Fact and must be stated as having taken place on some particular day.” The rule seems on 
the surface designed merely to promote Certainty in the Pleadings, and, though but little practical certainty can 
result from it, is necessary both to show upon the Record a material fact afterwards to be sustained by Proof, as well as, 
in the case of the Declaration, that the cause of action, upon the plaintiff s own showing, must always appear to have 
accrued before the commencement of the suit.*? It has been laid

down as a general principle, that whenever it is necessary to lay a Venue, it is also necessary to mention time.” 


WI-IEN TIME MUST BE TRULY STATED 


33. Whenever time forms a material point involving the merits of the case, it is of the substance of the issue, and 
hence must be correctly alleged. 


WI-IEN time enters into the terms of a contract, or is involved in any of its essential parts, the true time must be 
stated in pleading the contract, in order to avoid a Variance betwean the Pleading and the Proof.” Thus, where 
the Declaration stated a usurious contract made on December 21, 1774, with payment due on December 23, 
1776, and the proof was that the contract was executed on December 23, 1774, with payment due in two years, 
it was held that the Verdict must be for the defendant; the principle of this decision was that since the time given 


for the payment being of the substance of an usuriger v. Parish, 8 Serg. & B. (Pa.) 134 (1822), and eases cited. 

It is equally essential that no material fact be stated as having occurred alter the date or issuance of the writ, that being now regarded as the 
Commencement of the Action. Bemis v. Faxon, 4 Mass. 263 (1808); Waring v. Yates, 10 Johns. (N.Y.) 119 (1813); Bronson v. Earl, 17 Johns.

ous contract, such time had to be proved as laid.” 


So, where the Declaration alleged an usurious agreement on the 14th of the month, to forbear and give day of 
payment for a certain period, but it was proved that the money was not advanced until the 16th, the plaintiff was 
Nonsuited, it being held by Lord Mansfield at the Trial, and afterwards by the Court en banc, that the day from 
whence the forbearance took place was material, though laid under a Videlicet.” 


In pleading any written document, therefore, such a bill of exchange, promissory note, a record or a specialty, the 


Page 121 of 735 


day on which it is alleged to bear date, must be correctly alleged. Otherwise there will be a Variance between the 
writing itself when offered in evidence and the description of it in the pleading.” 


The same rule applies whenever the time stated in the pleadings on either side is to be proved by Record or by a 
written instrument referred to in the pleadings. This ruie in regard to written instruments is necessary for the 
further reason that the Record should thus show the true date, and thus constitute a bar to another suit on 
the same instrument by giving a different date, it having been one of the objects of the rule as to certainty, so far as 
the Declaration was concerned, that the Judgment rendered in the case should operate as a bar to any subse~uent 
action involving the same cause. 


WHEN TIME NEED NOT BE TRULY STATED

tic all matters, generally speaking, save those previously mentioned, time is considered as forming no Material 
Part of the Issue, so that the pleader, when required to allege a time for any Traversable Fact, is not compelled to 
allege it truly, and may state a fact as occurring at one time, and prove it as happening at a different time.” The 
reason of the rule is that as a thy is not an Independent Fact or Substantive Matter, but a mere circumstance or 
accompaniment of such matter, it obviously cannot in its own nature be material, and can only be made so, if at all, 
by the nature of the Fact or Matter in connection with which it is pleaded. Therefore, if a Tort is stated to have 


been committed,” or a parol contract made,” on a particular day, the plaintiff is in neither case confined in his Proof 
to the day as laid,

The words or phrase, “on or about” has been construed as taking away all certainty, then leaving the time indefinite. 


The pleader, however, “is subject to certain restrictions: 1, He should lay the Time under a videlicet, if he does not wish to be held to prove it 
strictly; 
2. He should not lay a Time that is intrinsically Impossible, or inconsistent with the fact to which It relates.” Stephen, A Treatise on the 
Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, c. XI, Of the Principal Rules of Pleading, § IV, Rule II, 279 (3d Am. ed. by Tyler, Washington,

but may support the Allegation by Proof of a different day, except that the day as laid in the Declaration, and as 


proved, must both be prior to the Commencement of the Suit.” As the plaintiff is not generally confined in 


Page 122 of 735 


evidence to the time stated in the Declaration, so the defendant is not restricted to that laid in the Plea; and so on 
through the Subsequent Pleadings. Obviously, a time should not be stated’ that is intrinsically impossible, or 
inconsistent with the fact to which it relates. A time so laid would generally be ground for Demurrer. However, there 
is no ground for demurrer if the time is unnecessarily laid as a Fact not Traversable, for an unnecessary statement of 
time, though impossible or inconsistent, will do no harm. 


Time to be alleged in the Plea 

WHERE time is not material to the Defense, and the matter of Complaint and Defense, from the nature of 
the case, must have occurred at one and the same time, the defendant in pleading must follow the day laid iii the 
Declaration. 


This general rule has long been established, and its effect is that the Plea must state the Matter of Defense as 
having occurred on the day mentioned in the Declaration, even though that be not the true day, unless the nature or 
circumstances of the Defense render it necessary for the defendant to vary from the time thus stated. Its object seems 
to be the prevention of an apparent discrepancy upon the Record in respect to time, where the alleged Cause of 
Action and the Defense pleaded actually occurred at one and the same time, and where the defendant is under no 
necessity of laying

As to the statement or time under Code Pleading, see Backns v. clark, I Kan. 303, 83 Am.Dec. 437 (1863). The rule still applies, and 
Time, when material, must be strictly laid and proved.

his Defense on a different day from that mentioned in the Declaration. The rule applies, however, only when time is 
immaterial, and therefore, if the Defense is such as to render it necessary that the true time be stated in the Plea, the 
Law allows the defendant to vary from the time mentioned in the Declaration. In all such cases the formal objection 
arising from the apparent discrepancy in time between the Declaration and the Plea yields to the more important 
principle that each party must be permitted to frame his Allegations according to the exigencies of his case. The 
principle is the same as laying the true Venue by the defendant in Transitory Actions when the nature of his defense requires 
1t. 


Again, the defendant is never required to follow the thy named in the Declaration in pleading Matter of Discharge, 
whether it be material or not, since all Matter of Discharge must, from its nature, have occurred subsequently to 
the creation of the duty or liability upon which the action is founded. It is therefore clear that in such case the 
defendant must state the Defense as having occurred after the wrong was done or the contract made; more especially 
if such Discharge was by Matter of Record, or by a written instrument, since the time must then be laid to conform to 
the date of such Record or Instrument. 


TIME OF CONTINUING ACTS 
35. When there is occasion to allege a conS tinuous act in pleading, the time of its duration should be shown, 


THIS rule applies generally where there is only one Count in the Declaration, and the subject matter of the suit 
consists of a continuing act by the defendant, covering many days. Here the act or acts should be alleged to have been 
committed on a given day and “on divers other days and times” between that and another day or the time of the 
commencement of the suit, and the plain-

tiff will be allowed to offer evidence only in proof of acts committed during the whole or some part of the period 
covered. 


Page 123 of 735 


DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY 


36. When the Declaration alleges an injury to goods or chattels, or a contract relating tu them, their quantity, 
quality and value or price should be stated; and in actions for the recovery of, or for injuries to, real property, quantity and 
quality should be shown. 


IT is, in general, necessary, where the Declaration alleges any injury to goods and chattels, or any contract 
relating to them, that their quality, quantity, and value or price should be stated. And in any action brought for 
recovery of real property, its quality should be shown, as whether it consists of houses, lands, or other 
hereditaments; and in general it should be stated whether the lands be meadow, pasture, or arable, etc. And the 
quantity of the lands or other real estate must also be specified. So, in an action brought for injuries to real property, 
the quality should be shown, as whether it consists of houses, lands, or other hereditaments,M Thus, in an Action of 
Trespass for breaking the plaintiff's close and taking away his fish, without showing the number or nature of the 
fish, it was, after Verdict, objected, in Arrest of Judgment—First, “that it did not appear by the Declaration of 


~3. Johnson v. Long, S Ld.Raym. 260, 92

what nature the fish were, pikes, tenches, breams, etc.; - and, secondly, that “the certain number of them did not 
appear.” And the objection was allowed by the whole court.” So, where, in an Action of Trespass, the Declaration 
charged the taking of cattle, the Declaration was held to be bad because it did not show of what species the cattle were”? 
So, in an Action of Trespass, where the plaintiff declared for taking goods generally, without specifying the 
particulars, a Verdict being found for the plaintiff, the court Arrested the Judgment for the uncertainty of the 
Declaration.” So, in a modern case, where, in an Action of Replevin, the plaintiff declared that the defendant, “in a 
certain dwelling house, took divers goods and chattels of the plaintiff,” without stating what’ the goods were, the Court 
Arrested the udgment for the uncertainty of the Declaration, after judgment by Default and a Writ of Inquiry 
executed.’ So, in aix Action of Dower, where blanks were left in the Count for the number of acres claimed, the 
Judgment was Reversed after Verdict.*° So, in Ejectment, the plaintiff declared for five closes of land, arabIc and 
pasture, called “Long Furlongs,” containing ten acres. Upon “Not Guilty” pleaded, the plaintiff had a Verdict, and it 
was moved in Arrest of Judgment that the Declaration was ill, because 

the quantity and quality of the lands were not distinguished and ascertained, so as to show how many acres of 
arable there were and how many of pasture. And for this reason the Declaration was held ill, and the Judgment 
Arrested.°°

THE DECLARATION—PLACE, TIME, TITLE 
Ch. 5 
With respect to value, it is to be observed that it should be specified in reference to the current coin of the realm, 
thus: “Divers, to wit, three tables of great value, to wit, the value of twenty dollars, of lawful money of the United 
States.” With respect to quantity, it should be specified by the ordinary measures of extent, weight, or capacity, thus: 


Page 124 of 735 


“Divers, to wit, fifty acres of arable land; -“divers, to wit, three bushels of wheat.” 


The rule in question, however, is not so strictly construed, but that it sometimes admits the specification of 
quality and quantity in a loose and general way. Thus, a Declaration in Trover for two packs of flax and two packs 
of hemp, without setting out the weight or quantity of a pack, is good after Verdict, and, as it seems, even upon 
Special Demurrer.” So, a Declaration in Trover, for a library of books, has been allowed, without expressing what 
they were. So, where the plaintiff declared in Trespass for entering his house, and taking several keys for the opening of 
the doors of his said house, it was objected, after Verdict, that the kind and number ought to be ascertained. But it was 
answered and resolved that the keys are sufficiently ascertained by reference to the house® So it was held, upon 
Special Demurrer, that it was sufficient to declare, in Trespass for breaking and entering a house, damaging the 
goods and chattels, and wrenching and forcing open the doors, without specifying the goods and chattels, or the 
number of doors forced open; for that the essential matter of the action was the breaking and entering of the 
house, and the rest merely Aggravation.”” The degree of certainty requisite in stating matters of the kind 
mentioned seems to be such as the facts in

each case will conveniently admit of, a general description being allowed where the matter to be described 
comprehends a multiplicity of particulars, a detailed description of which would either be impracticable or produce 
great prolixity in the pleadings,” and minuteness of description being required where a complete identification might be 
essential to a recovery.” 


As quantity and value, when brought in issue, are not generally material, it is sufficient that any quantity or value 
be alleged without risk of Variance in the event of a different amount being proved.” The only exceptions to this are 
where the above facts are alleged in the recital or Statement of a Record, written instrument, or express contract, 
in which cases, as in alleging time regarding the same subjects, number, quantity, etc., must be truly stated as they form 
part of the substance of the issue. For example, to a Declaration in Assumpsit for £10 4s., and other sums, the 
defendant pleaded, as to all but £4 is. 6d., the General Issue, and, as to the £4 7s. 6d., a tender. The plaintiff replied 
that, after the cause of action accrued, and before the tender, the plaintiff demanded the said sum of £4 7s. 6d., which 
the defendant refused to pay; and on issue joined it was proved that the plaintiff had demanded not £4 7s. 6d., but 
the whole £10 4s. This proof was held not to support the is-

Variance when the Proof is reached on the Trial. The Allegation of Quality in the subject matter, since it generally 
requires strict proof, falls directly within the reason of the rule, and must be truly stated.”

NAMES OF PERSONS 


37. The pleadings must specify the names of persons. This rule includes the names of per. sons necessarily 
mentioned in the pleadings, although they are not parties to the suit, and their names must be correctly stated; it also 
includes parties to the action. 


Persons Other than Parties 

TITS rule calls for strict accuracy in describing persons whose names are necessarily mentioned in the statement 
of the Cause of Action or Defense, though they are in no sense concerned in bringing or defending the action; and 
the reason is that any error in describing such persons may result in a fatal Variance when the Proof is reached, since the 
correct identification of such persons by name becomes a matter of essential description, material to the merits of the 
case.” 
If, in pleading a contract made by James Smith, the name is incorrectly given as John Smith, the strict rule would 
subject the pleader in fault to the penalty of a variance, though a more liberal practice now generally allows an 
Amendment where it does not substantially change the cause of action.

Some observations may be made here which apply equally whether the name be that of a person not a party to the 
suit, or that of one who is a party. A person may be described by the name by which he is commonly known, though 
it is not his true name, and if a man has initials for his Christian name, or is in the habit of using initials therefor, and 
is known by them, they may be used in describing him.” In a few states a middle name or initial is recognized by 
the law as a part of the name, and its omission, or a mistake in stating it, is a misnomer in the case of a party, and a 
Variance in the case of persons who are not parties, but are necessarily named.’” In most Jurisdictions, however, the 
law recognizes but one Christian name, The middle name or initial is no part of the name, and need not be stated, or 
proved, if stated.’* Where the name of a person is misspelled, this will not constitute a Variance, nor a Misnomer, if the

PARTIES TO THE ACTION 


38. The plaintiff and defendant must be designated by their proper names, and not by words of mete 
description; and it must be shown whether they appear in the action in an individual or a representative capacity. 
The parties to an action include all persons who are directly interested in the subject matter in issue, who have a 


right to control the proceedings, to make a Defense, or to Appeal front the Judgment. All others are regarded as strangers to 
the cause. 


THE effect of this rule is plainly apparent from its terms, as certainty in the pleadings in this respect must 
necessarily be required for purposes of identification. Both plaintiff and defendant should be described by their 
Christian names and surnames, and, if either be mistaken or omitted, it is ground for Plea in Abatement.” An

however, can now generally be cured by amending the defective pleading. A. liberal construction of the rule 
allows, as we have seen, the use of the names by which such parties are generally known,” though not strictly correct, 
and though the designation thus habitually used includes the person’s initials only.” Other questions applying both 
under this head, and also to naming persons not parties, have been noticed above. If a contract or promise sued 
upon has been made to or by the person by a wrong name, or by an abbreviation of his correct name, an action may 
be brought by or against him in his true name, setting forth the Incorrect style or description, and stating that the 
parties are the same.’° 


The effect of a mistake in the name of a person snot a party win, as above stated, amount to a fatal Variance when 
the Proof discloses the true name, It is otherwise where the mistake is in the name of a party. Here the objection 
can only be taken by a Plea in Abatement. It cannot be objected to as a Variance at the Trial.*°

Repetition of Names 


Page 128 of 735 


FOR the same purpose of identification, when the name of either party has been once introduced in the pleadings, 
a repetition of it shouid be accompanied by such terms of reference as will clearly trace the identity as the same, unless 
there is no danger of confusion. In any case, it is the better plan, and the common practice is, to use the word “said” 
or “aforesaid,” or, if there be two or more persons or subjects, “first aforesaid” or “last aforesaid,” or terms of 
equivalent import.” 


SHOWING TITLE 


39. The Pleadings must show Title, where it is material. More specifically: 
(1) A person asserting any right to or authority over real or personal property must allege a Title to such 
property in himself or in some person from whom he derives his authority. 
(Ii) When a person is to be charged in a pleading with any liability in respect to either real or personal property, 
his Title to such property must be alleged. 
Exception—No Title need be shown where the opposite party is estopped from denying it. 
WHEN, in pleading, any right or authority is set up in respect of property, personal or real, some Title to that 
property must of course be alleged in the party, or in some other person from whom he derives his authority.*° So, if 
a party be charged with any liability, in respect of property, personal

or real, his Title to that property must be alleged. 


We shall first consider the case of a party’s alleging Title in himself, or in another whose authority he pleads; next 
that of his alleging it in his adversary. 


The exception to this rule in cases where the opposite party is estopped from denying Title will be presently 
considered. 


TITLE IN THE PARTY OR IN ONE WHOSE AUTHORITY HE PLEADS 


40. ‘When Title is alleged in the party himself, or in one whose authority he pleads, a Title to the subject matter of the 
controversy must generally be set forth in the pleadings in its full and precise extent. To this rule there are two 
exceptions: 

(I) When the action is founded on possession only, and not on Title or Ownership, it is sufficient to allege a 
Title of Possession only, a naked Allegation of Possession being sufficient. This applies to Personal 
Actions only. 


(ID In some cases, where a Title of Possession is inapplicable, a general Freehold Title may be alleged in lieu of 
stating Title in its full and precise extent. 


Alleging Title of Possession 

IT is often sufficient to allege a Title of Possession only. The form of laying a Title of Possession, in respect 
of goods and chattels, is either to allege that they were the “goods and chattels of the plaintiff,” or that he was 
“lawfully possessed of them as of his own property.” With respect to corporeal hereditaments, the form is either 
to allege that the close, etc., was the “close of” the plaintiff, or that he was “lawfully possessed of a certain close,” 
etc. With respect to incorporeal hereditaments, a Title of Possession is generally laid by alleging that the plaintiff 
was possessed of the corporeal thing appurtenant to which is the right claimed, and by reason thereof was entitled to 
the right at the time in question; for example, 
that he “was possessed of a certain messuage,” etc., “and by reason thereof, during all the time aforesaid, of right 
ought to have had common of pasture,” etc. 


Page 129 of 735 


A Title of Possession is applicable_that is, will be sufficiently sustained by the proof 

—in all cases where the interest is of a present and immediate kind. Thus, when a Title of Possession is alleged with 
respect to goods and chattels, the statement will be supported by proof of any kind of present interest in them, 
whether that interest be temporary and special, or absolute, in its nature; as, for example, whether it be that of a 
carrier or finder, only, or that of an owner and proprietor.’’ So, where a Title in Possession is alleged in respect to 
corporeal or incorporeal hereditaments, it will be sufficiently maintained by proving any kind of estate in pos- 
session, whether fee simple, fee tail, for life, for term of years, or otherwise. On the other hand, with respect to any 
kind of property, a Title of Possession would not be sustained in evidence by proof of an interest in remainder or 
reversion only; and therefore, when the interest is of that description, the preceding forms are inapplicable, and Title 
must be laid in remainder or reversion, according to the fact, and upon the principles that will be afterwards stated, 
on the subject of alleging Title in its full and precise extent. 


Where a Title of Possession is applicable, the Allegation of it is, in many cases, sufficient, in pleading, without 
showing Title of a Superior kind, The rule on this subject is as follows; That it is sufficient to allege possession as 
against a wrongdoer,” or in

stance, in modern practice, of the Allegation of a Title of this character. 


Under the head of “Allegation of Title,” In its full and precise extent, we shall consider the statement of the 
Derivation of the Title, and then certain general rules as to the Allegation of the Titles themselves. 


In general it is sufficient to state a seisin In fee simple per se; that is, simply to state, according to the usual form 
of alleging that Title, that the party was “seized in his demesne as of fee of and in a certain messuage,” etc., 
without showing the derivation, or, as it is expressed in pleading, the commencement of the estate; ss for, if it were 
requisite to show from whom the present tenant derived his Title, it might be required, on the same principle, to show 
from whom that person derived his, and so ad infinitum. Besides, as mere seisin will be sufficient to give an estate 
in fee simple, the estate may, for anything that appears, have had no other commencement than the seisin itself which is 
alleged. Even though the fee be conditional or determinable on a certain event, yet a seisin in fee may be alleged, 
without showing the commencement of the estate.” 


To this rule, however, there is this exception: It is necessary to show the derivation of the fee, where, in the 
pleading, the seisin has already been alleged in another person, from whom the present party claims. In such case it must, 
of course, be shown bow it passed from one of these persons to the other. Thus, in Debt or Covenant brought on an 


indenture of lease by the heir of the lessor, the plaintiff, having alt. Scavnge v. Rnwkins, Cro.Car. 572, 79 Bog-Rep.

leged that his ancestor was seized in fee and made the lease, must proceed to show how the fee passed to himself, 


viz, by descent.‘ So, if in trespass, the defendant plead that EJ~’., being seised in fee, demised to G.M., under whose 
command the defendant Justifies the trespass on the land, Giving Color, and the plaintiff, in his Replication, admits E.ff-’s 
seisin, but sets up a Subsequent Title in himself to the same land, in fee simple, prior to the alleged demise, he must show 
the derivation of the fee from FE’. to himself, by conveyance antecedent to the lease under which OH, claims.”

ALLEGING DERIVATION OF TITLE— PARTICULAR ESTATES 


42. In pleading a Particular Estate, its commencement must he shown, except where Title is alleged only as 
Inducement. 


WITH respect to particular estates, the general rule is that the commencement of Particular Estates must be 
shown.” The meaning of this rule is that, when a party sets up in his own favor an estate for life, a term of years, or a 
tenancy at will, he must show the Derivation of that Title from its commencement—that is, from the last seisin in 
fee simple; and, if derived by alienation or conveyance, the substance and effect of such conveyances should be 
precisely set forth. The reason for the diversity between this and the rule as to estates in fee appears to be that, as an 
estate in fee simple may be

blends law and fact. Hence, where title to particular estates is thus alleged, the time and manner of the derivation 
must be shown, in order that a Traverse may be taken upon any particular point in the Title. 


To the rule that the Commencement of a Particular Estate must be shown there is this exception, namely, that it 
need not be shown where Title is alleged by way of Inducement only. Thus, in an Action of Debt or Covenant, 
brought on an indenture of lease by the executor or assignee of a lessor for a term of years, it is necessary, in the 
Declaration, to state the Title of the lessor in order to show the plaintiff’ s right to sue as assignee or executor; but, as 
the Title is thus alleged only by way of Inducement, the Particular Estate for years may be alleged in the lessor, 
without showing its commencement.* 


TITLE BY INHERITANCE 


43. Where a party claims by inheritance, he must, in general, show how he is the heir; and if he claims by mediate, 
and not immediate, descent, he must show the pedigree. 


THUS, in pleading his Title by inheritance, a party must in general show how he became the heir, that is, 
by showing the seizin and death of the ancestor, after whose decease the title descended to the plaintiff as son 
and heir; and if he claim by mediate descent

he must allege and prove the pedigree.~ Thus, in Heard v. Baskervile,° where the plaintiff brought Replevin, it was 
pleaded that the rent descended to a cousin and heir, etc., without showing how the cousin became heir, and 
the plaintiff Demurred Generally, thus raising an issue of law as to whether the failure to set down the matter of 


cousenage constituted a Defect of Substance, or of Form, such as by the Statute of Demurrers, 27 Eliz. c. 5, § 1 


Page 131 of 735 


(1285), ought to be particularly set down, or else no advantage be taken of it. It was held that the descent, being 
mediate, should have been set forth, but that the failure to do so constituted a Defect in Form, and hence was 
waived by the General Demurrer, as provided by the Statute; the defect, in other words, would have been available 
upon Special Demurrer. 


e TITLE BY ALIENATION OR CONVEYANCE 


44. When a party claims title by conveyance or alienation, the nature of the conveyance or alienation must, in general, be 
stated. 


WHERE a party relies upon title by conveyance or alienation, he must allege or set forth the nature of the 
conveyance or alienation in his pleading, as whether it be devise, feoffment, or some other form of transfer.’ 


MANNER OF PLEADING CONVEYANCE 
45. The nature of the conveyance or alienation should be stated according to its Legal Effect, rather than its 
form of words. 


THIS rule involves a specific application of the general rule that in suing upon written contracts or 
documents they are to be alleged or set forth according to their Legal Effect or Operation, and not Verbatim. As 
applied to~

Sec. 46 
STATUTE OF FRAUDS 
121 
the manner of pleading conveyances this doctrine means that in their pleading they must be alleged according to the 
extent of the Title which they actually pass. Thus, in pleading a conveyance for life, it must be alleged as a “demise” for 
life; or a conveyance in tail, with a livery of seizin, as a gift in tail; sand a conveyance of the fee, with livery, is 
described by the term “enfeoffed.” 10 And the form of pleading must still be the same, whatever might be the words 
of donation used in the instrument of conveyance, if the effect of the latter remains unchanged.” 


THE WRITTEN CONVEYANCE AND THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS 


46. In pleading Title by Conveyance, if the nature of the conveyance is such that it would, at Common Law, be 
valid without a deed or other written instrument, then no deed or writing need be alleged in the pleading, even though 
such document may in fact exist. But where the nature of the conveyance requires, at Common Law, a deed or other 
written instrument, such instrument must be alleged. There are two exceptions to this rule: 

(D Where Title is pleaded under a written lease for years; and 


(II) Where a Demise by husband and wife is pleaded. 


The Rule Where the Conveyance was Valid at Common Law 

AT Common Law, a conveyance in fee, in tall, or for life, when accompanied by livery of seisin, could be made 
by parol only, and was therefore pleaded without the Allegation of any charter or other writing, whether such 
instrument in fact accompanied the conveyance or not, as such a conveyance might, 


S. Rastell’s Entries, 647a, lid (London 1596). 


Page 132 of 735 


S. Coke’s Entries, tit. Formedon, &e. (London 1614). 


10. With respect to livery and feofment It has been stated that ‘wlthout livery it Is no feofment, gift, or demise”. vyniar’s Case, S 
Co.Eep. Sib, 82b, 77 Eng.Rep. 597, 600 (1609). 

at Common Law, be made by parol only.” And though, by the Statute of Frauds,’* such a conveyance will not now 

be valid unless made in writing, the form of the pleading nevertheless remains the same as before the enactment of 

the Statute in 1676. The reason for this is that the Statute of Frauds merely introduces a new rule of evidence but 

does not alter or affect the rule of pleading. 


The Rule Where the Conveyance was Only Authorized by Statute 

CONTRARY to the Common-Law Rule where the conveyance was valid even though by parol, where a devise of 
land was involved, which, at Common Law, was not valid, and which was authorized by the first Statute of Wills, in 
1540,’~ and the second Statute of Wills in 1542,’~ it was required to be alleged to have been made in writing, as 
that was the only form in which the Statute authorized it to be made.’° And so, if a conveyance by way of grant 
be pleaded, a deed must be alleged," for matters that “lie in grant” can pass by deed only.'* 


Two Exceptions to the Common-Law Rule 
THE first exception to the rule that if the nature of a conveyance is such that it would, 


12. The rule is the same as applied to ordinary contracts. Thus, in Whitehead v. Burgess, 61 N.J.L. 75, 38 At. 802 (1897), Van Syckel, J., 
declared: “Where an action is founded upon a contract which at Common Law is valid without writing, but which the Statute 
requires to be In writing, the Declaration need not Count upon or take notice of the writing. If an action is brought upon a 
promise to pay the debt of another, the Declaration need not aver that the promise is in writing, even if such be the fact.”

at Common Law, be valid without a deed or other written instrument, it need not be alleged in the pleading, is 
one which exists in practice, at least. Thus, in making title under a lease for years, by indenture, it is mis-ternary to plead 
the indenture, though the lease was good, at Common Law, by parol, and need now be in writing only where it 
is for a term of more than three years, and then only by reason of the Statute of Frauds?” 


The second exception involves a case in which it is not necessary to allege a deed, though the Common Law 
requires one. Thus, in pleading a Demise by husband and wife, it is not necessary to show that it was by deed, 
though both by the Common Law and by Statute such a Demise could be by deed only.” 


WHERE A PARTY ALLEGES TITLE IN HIS ADVERSARY 


47. It is not generally necessary to allege Title in the opposing party more precisely than Is sufficient to show a 
liability in the party charged, or to defeat his present claim. 


THUS far we have been discussing the case of a party alleging Title in himself or in some other under whose 
authority he pleads. It remains for us to consider the case of a party’s alleging Title in his adversary. The rule on this 
subject is that it is not necessary to allege Title more precisely than is sufficient to show a liability in the party 


Page 133 of 735 


charged, or to defeat his present claim. Except as far as these objects require, a party cannot be compelled to show 
the precise estate his adversary holds, even in a case where, if the same person were pleading his own Title, a 
full and complete statement would be necessary. The reason for the difference is that a party must be presumed to 
be ignorant of the particulars

of his adversary’s Title, though he is bound to know his own.” 
WHAT IS A SUFFICIENT ALLEGATION OF LIABILITY 
48. To show a liability in the party charged, it is generally sufficient to allege a Title of Possession. 


AS in the case where a party pleads his own Title or that of another through whom he claims, and that Title need 
not be fully and precisely stated, it is also generally sufficient, where the opposite party is to be charged with 
liability, to allege merely a Title of Possession in such party. The same distinctions as to the nature of the interest or 
right, however, are still to be observed; and therefore, if the interest is by way of reversion or remainder, and 
cannot be sustained by proof of some present interest in chattels or the actual possession of land, this form of 
pleading Title is inapplicable. There are cases in which, to charge a party with mere possession, would not be 
sufficient to show his liability. Thus, in declaring against a person in Debt for Rent, as assignee of a term of years, it 
would not be sufficient to show that he was possessed, but it must be shown that he was possessed as assignee of the 
term. Where a Title of Possession is thus inapplicable or insufficient, and some other or superior Title must be 
shown, it is still unnecessary to allege the Title of an adversary with the same precision and accuracy as where the 
party states his own,” the requirement being only that the Allegation shall be sufficient to show the liability 
charged. Therefore, though, as we have seen, it is the rule, with respect to a man’s

own Title, that the commencement of Particular Estates should be shown, unless alleged by way of Inducement, 
yet, in pleading the Title of an adversary, it seems that this is, in general, not necessary.” So, in cases where it 
happens to be requisite to show whence the adversary derived his Title, this may be done with less precision than 
where a man alleges his own. And, in general, it is sufficient to plead such Title by a que estate; that is, to allege 
that the opposite party has the same estate, or that the same estate is vested in him, as has been precedently laid in 
some other person, without showing in what manner the estate passed from the one to the other.” Thus, in Debt, 
where the defendant is charged for rent, as assignee of the term, after several mesne assignments, it is sufficient, 
after stating the original demise, to allege that, “after making the said indenture, and during the term thereby 
granted, to wit, on the 
dayof ,intheyear sat 


_ all the estate and interest of the said E.F. [the originai lessee] of and in the said demised premises, by 
assignment, came to and vested in the said C.D.”; without further showing the nature of the mesne assignments.” 
But, if the case be reversed, that is, if the plaintiff, claiming as assignee of the reversion, sue the lessee for rent, he 
must precisely show the conveyances, or other media of Title, by which he became entitled to the reversion; and to 
say, generally, that it came by assignment, will not, in this case, be sufficient, without circumstantially alleg

ing, all the mesne assignments.~ Upon the same principle, if Title be laid in an adversary by descent, as, for 
example, where an Action of Debt is brought against an heir on the bond of his ancestor, it is sufficient to charge 
him as heir, without showing how he is heir, viz, as son, or otherwise,” but if a party entitle himself by inheritance, 
we have seen that the mode of descent must be alleged. 


PROOF OF TITLE AS ALLEGED 


49. Title is ordinarily of the substance of the issue, and must be strictly proved. 


THE manner of showing title, both where it is laid in the party himself, or the person whose authority he 
pleads, and where it is laid in his adversary, having been now considered, it may next be observed that the title so 
shown must, in general, when issue is taken upon it, be strictly proved. With respect to the Allegations of place, 
time, quantity, and value, it has been seen that, when issue is taken upon them, they, in most cases, do not require 
to be proved as laid; at least, if laid under a videlicet. But with respect to title, it is, ordinarily, of the Substance of the 
Issue, and therefore, required to be maintained accurately by the proof. Thus, in an action on the Case, the plaintiff 
alleged in his Declaration that he demised a house to the defendant for seven years, and that, during the term, the 
defendant so negligently kept his fire that the house was burned down. And the defendant having pleaded ncm 
denzisit modo et forma, it appeared in evidence that the plaintiff had demised to the defendant several tenements, 
of which the house in question *as one; but that, with respect to this house, it was, by an exception in the

lease, demised at will only. The Court held that though the plaintiff might have declared against the defendant as 
tenant at will only, and the action would have lain, yet, having stated a demise for seven years, the proof of a lease at 
will was a Variance, and that in substance, not in form only; and, on the ground of such Variance, Judgment was 
given for the defendant.” 


ESTOPPEL OP ADVERSE PARTY 


50, Where the opposite party is estopped from denying a Title, none need be shown. 


THE rule which requires that Title should be shown having been now explained, it will be proper to notice an 
exception to which it is subject. This exception is that no Title need be shown where the opposite party is estopped 
from denying the title. Thus, in an action for goods sold and delivered, it is unnecessary, in addition to the allegation 
that the plaintiff sold and delivered them to the defendant, to state that they were the goods of the plaintiff; for a buyer 
who has accepted and enjoyed the goods cannot dispute the Title of the seller. So, in debt or covenant brought by the lessor 
against the lessee on the covenants of the lease, the plaintiff need allege no Title to the premises demised, because a 
tenant is estopped from denying his landlord’s Title, On the other hand, however, a tenant is not bound to admit 
Title to any extent greater than might authorize the lease; and therefore, if the action be brought, not by the lessor 
himself, but by his heir, executor, or other representative or assignee, the title of the former must be alleged, in 


Page 135 of 735 


order to show that the reversion is now legally vested in the plaintiff in the character in which he sues. Thus, if he 
sue as heir, he must allege that the lessor was seised in fee, for the tenant is not bound to admit that he was seised 
in fee;

and, unless he was so, the plaintiff cannot claim as heir.” 


SHOWING AS TO AUTHORITY 


51. In general, where a defendant justifies under a writ, warrant, precept, or other authority, it must be particulary set 
forth in his pleading; and in such case he should also show that such authority had been substantially pursued. 


Exception—Where an authority may be verbal and general, it may be pleaded in general terms. 


THIS is an instance, under the general rule requiring certainty in the pleadings, where a greater degree is 
required in the Plea than in the Declaration. Where in an Action of Trespass, the defendant seeks to Plead a 
Justification under such an authority as is mentioned above, he must set it forth particularly in his pleading, and it is not 
sufficient to Allege Generally that he committed the act complained of by virtue of a writ, warrant, or precept 
delivered to him.*° It must not only be specifically described, but the defendant, in order to render his Justification 
complete, should further aver that such authority was substantially pursued. The principle of the rule is that as a Plea 
in Bar, to be effective, must answer all that it assumes to answer, so all material Allegations which make up the 
answer it contains must be fully and particularly stated, or the Plea will be defective on Demurrer,” In all cases, 
therefore, where the defendant justifies under judicial process, he must set forth the facts in detail, though there 
are important distinctions as to the degree of particularity re

qttired by the rules of pleading in different eases. These may be stated as follows: (1) It is unnecessary for any 
person justifying under judicial process to set forth the cause of action in the original suit in which such process 
issued.” (2) If the Justification is by an officer executing a Writ, he is required to plead such Writ only, and not the 
Judgment on which it was founded; ~ but if such Justification is by any one except such officer, even a party to 
the action, the Judgment must be set forth as well.” (3) Where an officer thus justifies, he must show that the 
Writ was duly returned, if a return is legally necessary.” (4) When it is necessary, for the purposes of a justification, 
to Plead the Judgment ef a Court of Record, this may be done without setting forth any of the previous proceedings 
in the suit in which such Judgment was rendered.*° (5) When the Justification is founded on process issuing out of 
an Inferior Court or a Court of Foreign Jurisdiction, the nature and extent of the Jurisdiction of such Court should 
be shown, as well as that the cause of action arose within ~ In general, in pleading the Judgments of Inferior Courts, 
the previous proceedings are stated to some extent, though they may be set forth in a concise and summary 
manner.

This rule applies only at Common Law, being one relating to purely formal Allegations in Pleading. An inspection of written Instruments 


upon which an Action is founded, or which are in any way material to it, is provided for by special provisions in all the Codes. Judge of 
Probate v. Merrill, 6 N.H. 256 (1833).

allege should be set forth. So much only is stated as is material to the purpose, of which the example last cited will also serve for illustratioa. 
The other party, however, may reasonably desire to hear the whole, and this either for the purpose of enabling him to ascertain the 
genuineness of the alleged deed, or of founding on some part of its contents, not set forth by the adverse pleader, some matter of answer. He Is

was done by actually producing the deed in Court at the time of the Oral Allegations, but it is now done by an 
Allegation in the Declaration or Plea, as the case may be, of its production in court,—thus: “By his certain writing 
obligatory, sealed with his seal, and now shown to the Court,” etc.“* A failure to comply with this rule renders the 
Declaration or Plea demurrable. 


WRITINGS PLEADED ACCORDING 
TO LEGAL EFFECT 


53. Contracts and conveyances are to be pleaded according to their legal effect or operation. As an instrument or 
other matter alleged in pleading must principally and ultimately be considered with reference to its effect in law, it 
should therefore be stated according to its Legal Effect or operation and not according to its terms. 

The pleader is ordinarily allowed to set up the instrument in its very words, if he prefers not to construe its Legal 
Effect. 


CONTRACTS and conveyances are to be pleaded according to their legal effect or operation.” The meaning 
of the rule is that,

in stating an instrument or other matter in pleading, it should be set forth, not according to its terms or its form, but 
according to its effect in law; and the reason seems to be that it is under the latter aspect that it must principally and 
ultimately be considered, and therefore to plead it in terms or form only is an indirect and circuitous method of Al- 
legation. Thus, if a joint tenant conveys to his companion by the Words “gives,” “grants,” etc, his estate in the lands 
holden in jointure, this, though in its terms a “grant,” is not properly such in operation of law, but amounts to that 
species of conveyance called a “release.” It should therefore be pleaded, not that he “granted,” etc., but that he 


Page 138 of 735 


“released,” etc.*° So, if a tenant for life grant his estate to him in reversion, this is, in effect, a surrender, and must be 
pleaded as such, and not as a grant.” So, where the Plea stated that A was entitled to an equity of redemption, and, 
subject thereto, that B Was seised in fee, and that they, by lease and re-lease, granted, etc., the premises, excepting 
and reserving to A and his heirs, etc., a liberty of hunting, etc., it was held upon General Demurrer, and afterwards 
upon Writ of Error, that as A had no legal interest in the land, there could be no reservation to him; that the Plea, 
therefore, alleging the right, though in terms of the deed, by way of reservation, was bad; and that if, as was 


contended in argument, the deed would operate as a grant of the right, the Plea should have been so pleaded, and should 
have alleged a grant, and not a reservation.*S

While the party must state correctly the contract or instrument on which he relies) and, if the evidence differ 
from the statement, the whole foundation of his action will fail, he is not compelled to follow the precise form of 
words in either, and it suffices if he alleges their true legal effect or operation. The rule is thus one of utility, since it 
enables a party to state his matter briefly and With precision, without setting out the terms of contracts or 
instruments which often, even in modern conveyancing, reach an interminable length, and to support his allegations 
by the offer of the contract or instrument itself at the trial. A deed may often be thus pleaded Without using a word 
which ft contains, except the names of the parties, the dates, and the sums.” In all cases, care must be taken that the legal 
effect of the contract or instrument is accurately stated, or the result will be the same as if the statement of either in 
detail is incorrect; that is, a Variance. 


The rule in question is, in its terms, often confined to deeds and conveyances. It extends, however, to all 
instruments in writing, and contracts, written or verbal; and, indeed, it may be said, generally, to all matters or 
transactions whatever which a party may have occasion to allege in pleading, and in which the form is 
distinguishable from the legal effect.M Where, however, a written instrument is set out in hace verbcz) it will be 
sufficient, and the pleader need not dedare further its Legal Effect, as the Court will construe it for him. If he 
does aver its

It is a technical rule that Common-Law Pleading cannot be done by exhibits. In the case of Pcarsons v. Lee,” 
the Illinois Court said: “To the Declaration is annexed a copy of the agreement, and if the Court were permitted to 
look to that copy, which it cannot see with legal eyes, because it has been constantly decided by this Court to 
form no part of the Declaration, it might perceive that the agreement is signed by the defendant only.” The rule that a 
separate writing cannot be made a part of the pleading, by attaching it thereto and referring to it therein, is changed 
in Code Pleading. 


DAMAGES—GENERAL AND SPECIAL 


Page 139 of 735 


54. When the object of an action is to recover damages, an Essential Allegation of the Declaration is that the injury is 
to the Damage of the plaintiff, and the amount of that Damage must be specified. The recovery cannot, in general, exceed 
the amount thus stated, though it may be less. 

General Damages are such as may be regarded as the direct, natural, or probable result of the wrong complained 
of, and may be stated in a general manner. 

And Special Damages are those which the law does not regard as the necessary conse

quences of the wrongful act, and must be set forth specially and circumstantially, or evidence of them will not be 

received on the Trial. 


IN those cases where damages are the principal object of the action, the amount laid in the Declaration should be 
sufficient to cover the real demand, as the plaintiff cannot generally recover a greater amount than he has declared 
for and laid in the conclusion of his Declaration” If a Verdict should be for a greater amount, the surplus must be 
remitted before Judgment entered,M but no inconvenience will arise if the amount claimed is greater than that 
proved, as the Jury may find a less sum; and it is to be presumed, after Verdict, that the amount of damages 
ascertained by them was assessed according to the proof.” If the Declaration, however, expressly avers that the 
plaintiff has sustained Damages from a cause occurring subsequent to the Commencement of the Action, or previous 
to the plaintiff having any right of action, and the Jury gives entire Damages, judgment will be arrested)'°

cs where thc Allegation of Damages is unnecessary; as in scire facias upon a Record, which is merely an action to 
obtain Execution upon an ascertained right of Record; and in a penal action, at the suit of a common informer, where the 
plaintiff’ s right to the penalty did not accrue until the bringing of the suit, and no Damage could therefore have been 
sustained. 


Page 140 of 735 


The force and effect of the ancient rules of pleading in modern times is nowhere better illustrated than by this very 
rule as to damages and the manner of stating them, and perhaps no better commentary upon the importance of a 
thorough understanding of those rules can be found. We have above seen that in every Personal or Mixed Action the 
Declaration should allege some damage, and this rule has never been changed, though its force in cases where 
damages are merely nominal seems rather doubtful. The method of applying the rule is as applicable today as at any 
former time, and the establishment of Code Practice has made no difference; the distinction above noted being 
always observed, as the pleader will find to his cost if it be disregarded. This distinction is an important one, as it 
arbitrarily controls the manner in which the claim for Damages must be stated. 


When the damage claimed is the necessary and proximate consequence of the act complained of, the law 
presumes it to have resulted from that act, and it is sufficient to describe it in general terms, for the reason that the 
opposite party will not be unduly 
taken by surprise.” But, when the plaintiff suffers some peculiar or unusual loss it is essential that the resulting 
Damage, called “Special Damages,” be shown with particularity.~~ Such Damages are either super-added to 
General Damages arising from an act injurious in itself, as when some particular loss results from the utterance of 
slanderous words actionable in themselves, or such as arise from an act indifferent, and not actionable in itself, but 
injurious only in its consequences, as when words become actionable only by reason of the Special Damage 
ensuing. 


57. Thus, when a person is slandered in his trade, the Law infers that aa injury resulted to him, without its being particularly alleged. See 
Hutebinson 
v. Granger, 13 Vt. 380 (1841); West Chicago St. B. Co. v. Levy, 182 Ill. 525, 55 N.E. 554 (1899) (general damages from injury to the back,

commission directly and positively.’ If, for instance, a Dec-

assault,” etc., instead of “for that the said C.D. heretofore, to wit,” etc., “made an assault,” etc., it is bad, for nothing 
is positively affirmed. As such an Allegation violates a Rule of Pleading, it creates a Defect in Form, which is fatal 


only on Special Demurrer,” and, further than this, it may now generally be remedied by Amendment. Originally, such 
a Defect was regarded as one in Substance.*

CERTAINTY IN GENERALS 

56. In general, whatever is alleged in Plead-Mg must be alleged with Certainty, Definiteness and Precision. A clear, distinct, 
and complete Statement of the Facts which constitute the plaintiff's Cause of Action or the defendant’s Ground of Defense must 
be made in all Pleadings, in order that due notice may be given to the Adverse Party, and that a Definite and Certain 
Issue may be produced for decision. Where, however, the Facts lay within the knowledge of the defendant, and where 
no other method was possible, General Allegations were permitted. 

THE Concept of Certainty in Pleading includes both particularity and precision. It consists in alleging the Facts 
necessary so distinctly and explicitly as to show the legal basis of the Right or Defense asserted, give notice to the 
Adverse Party of what he is called upon to answer, and produce single, clear-cut, well-defined Issues of Fact or of 
Law for decision.6 The varying amount of particularity required has given rise to attempts to define the different 
Degrees of Certainty. The classic division proclaimed by Lord Coke, however, does not convey any intelligible 


idea of the distinctions recognized by the law. 
Under Coke’s Classification,’ there are three Degrees of Certainty, namely: (1)

particularity sufficient to apprise the Court and the other Party of the exact nature of the question to be tried.”

Certainty to a Common Intent; (2) Certainty to a Certain Intent in General; and (3) Certainty to a Certain Intent in 
Every Particular. 


The First Degree of Certainty in Coke’s Thininflation 

A PLEADING is Certain to a Common Intent when it is clear enough according to reasonable intendment or 
construction, though not worded with absolute precision.’ Common Intent cannot add to a sentence words which have been 
omitted, the Rule being one of construction only, and not one of addition. This is the lowest Form of Certainty which 
the Rules or Pleading allow, and is sufficient only in Pleas in Bar, Rejoinders, and such Other Pleadings on the part 
of the defendant as go to the action.” 


The Second Degree of Certainty 

CERTAINTY to a Certain Intent in General is a higher degree than Certainty to a Common Intent, and means what, 
upon a fair and reasonable construction, may be called Certain, without referring to possible facts,’° which do not

The Third Degree of Certainty—to a Certain Intent in Every Particular 

CERTAINTY to a Certain Intent in Every Particular requires the utmost fullness and particularity of statement, as 
well as the highest attainable accuracy and precision, leaving nothing to be supplied by argument, inference or 
presumption, and no supposable answer wanting.’* The Pleader must not only state the Facts of his own case in 
the most precise way, but must add to them such Facts as will anticipate the case of his Adversary. This Degree 
of Certainty is required only in case of Dilatory Pleas and Pleas in Estoppel.” 


With respect to Coke’s tests or Degrees of Certainty, it may be remarked that this is a matter of relative 
particularity which does not admit of measurement.'? Modern cases take as the standard reasonable Certainty 
without an attempt to define the Degrees for particular Pleadings.” Excessive Certainty

is not required, especially if too great prolixity would result therefrom, unless the Law is hostile to the Action or 
Defense. 


In Modern Times, it comes down to little more than this, that in Certain Disfavored 
Actions, such as Actions for Defamation; and in Certain Disfavored Defenses, such as 


Dilatory Pleas, more Facts must be alleged to make out a prima facie case or to repel hostile construction 
than in ordinary cases. 


Illwstrat ions 
IN Pleading the Performance of a Condition or Covenant, it is a Rule, though open to exceptions that will be 
presently noticed, that the Party must not Plead Generally that he performed the Covenant or Condition; but must 
show specially the Time, Place, and Manner of Performance; and, even though the subject to be performed 
should consist of several different acts, yet he must show in this special way the Performance of each.” 


Yet this Rule, requiring Performance to be specially shown, admits of relaxation where the subject comprehends 
such multiplicity of matter as would lead to great prolixity; and a More General Mode of Allegation is in such 
cases allowable. 

When in any of these excepted cases, however, a General Plea of Performance is Pleaded, the Rule under 

discussion still requires the plaintiff to show Particularly in his RepsE, 843 (i912~ Taylor v. New Jersey Title Guaran- 

tee & ‘tnst Co., 70 N.J.L. 24, 56 A. 152 (1903) in which It was held that circumstantial details were not necessary. 

Ilcation in what way the Covenant or Condition has been broken; for otherwise no sufficiently certain Issue would 
be attained. Thus, in an Action of Debt on a Bond conditioned for Performance of Affirmative and Absolute 
Covenants contained in a certain indenture, if the defendant Pleads Generally (as in that case he may) that he 
Performed the Covenants according to the Condition, the plaintiff cannot in his Replication Tender Issue with a 
mere Traverse of the words of the Plea, viz., that the defendant did not Perform any of the Covenants, etc.; for this 
Issue would be too wide and uncertain. But he must Assign a Breach, showing specifically in what particular, and in 
what manner, the Covenants have been broken.'° 


In an Action of Debt on a Bond conditioned to pay so much money yearly while certain letters patent were in 
force, the defendant Pleaded that from such a time to such a time he did pay, and that then the letters patent became 
void and of no force. The plaintiff having Replied, it was adjudged, on Demurrer to the Replication, that the Plea 
was bad, because it did not show how the letters patent became void.” 


With respect to all points on which Certainty of Allegation is required, it may be remarked, in general, that the 
Allegation, when brought into Issue, is required to be proved, in substance, as laid; and that the relaxation from 
the ordinary Rule on this subject which is allowed with respect to Place, Time, Quantity, and Value, does 
not, generally speaking, extend to other particulai~.

DECLARATION—MANNER OF PLEADING 
Ch. 6 
WHEN A GENERAL MODE OF 
PLEADING IS PROPER 


57. A General Mode of Pleading is allowed when great prolixity is thereby avoided. And a Statement of Material 
Facts in a Pleading with unnecessary particularity, where a brief and Concise Allegation would be sufficient, not only tends 
to cause prolixity and confusion, but may subject the Party thus Pleading to the 
penalty of a Variance, by his inability to prove it as alleged. 


WHILE the form in which the Rule above is stated has been objected to as indefinite, its extent arid application may 
be collected with some degree of precision from the decided cases,”! and by considering the limitations which it 
necessarily receives from the Rules as to Certainty heretofore mentioned. It substantially covers the same ground, 
and rests upon the same principle, as the Rule that a Pleading must State Facts, and not Evidence, and may be 
considered as applicable whenever an Allegation of the Facts in detail would carry the Pleading to an unrea- 
sonable length by Stating matters proper to be shown in Evidence. Besides the benefit derived from thus confining 
the Pleadings to reasonable limits, a General Mode of stating the existence of Facts involving in themselves 
matters of detail may often preserve the Pleader from exposing his Allegation to the danger of a Variance, since, if 
he attempts to state all such matters, he must do so correctly, or his Proof will not correspond.

In Assumpsit, on a promise by the defendant to pay for all such necessaries as his friend should be provided with 
by the plaintiff, the plaintiff alleged that he provided necessaries amounting to such a sum. It was moved, in Arrest of 
Judgment, that the Declaration was not good, because he had not shown what necessaries in particular he had 
provided. But Coke, C. 3., said, “This is good, as is here Pleaded, for avoiding such multiplicities of reckonings” ; 
and Doddridge, J., “This General Allegation, that he had provided him with all necessaries, is good, without 
showing in particular what they were.” And the Court gave Judgment unanimously for the plaintiff.” So, in As- 
sumpsit for labor and medicines, for curing the defendant of a distemper, the defendant Pleaded Infancy. The plaintiff 
Replied that the Action was brought for necessaries generally. On Demurrer to the Replication, it was objected that the 
plaintiff had not assigned in certain, how, or in what manner, the medicines were necessary; but it was adjudged 
that the Replication, in this General Form, was good, and the plaintiff had Judgment.” So, in Debt on a Bond, 
conditioned that the defendant shall pay, from time to time, the moiety of all such money as he shall receive, and give 


Page 146 of 735 


account of it, he Pleaded Generally that he had paid the moiety of all such money, etc. lit per curiam: “This 
Plea of Payment is good, without showing the particular sums, and that in order to avoid stuffing the Rolls with 
Multiplicity of 

Matter.” Also they agreed that, if the condition had been to pay the moiety of such money as he should receive, 
without saying “from time to time,” the payment should have been Pleaded Specially.”

Sec. 59 
WHAT PARTICULARITY IS REQUIRED 
135 
WHEN GENERAL PLEADING IS SUFFICIENT 


78. A General Mode of Pleading is often sufficient when the Allegations on the other side must reduce the matter to 
Certainty. And when the Nature of the Defense to be interposed is such that the Opposing Party must necessarily state fully 
all Facts essential to the production of a complete Issue in the particular action, a Party may allege the grounds of his Action 
or Defense, or seine of them, in General Terms. 


THIS Rule comes into most frequent illustration in Pleading Performance in Actions of Debt on Bond. Bonds 
may be conditioned either for the Performance of certain matters set forth in the Condition, or of the Covenants or 
other matters contained in an indenture or other instrument collateral to the Bond, and not set forth in the Condition. 
In either case, if the defendant has to Plead Performance of such matters, the Law often allows him to do so, in 
General Terms, without setting forth the manner of Performance. For by the usual course of Pleading, the plaintiff 
declares upon the Bond as single, without noticing the Condition, and therefore without alleging any Breach of the 
Condition. It follows, therefore, of course, that if the defendant Pleads Performance, the plaintiff will have to show a 
Breach in his Replication; and as this will, in all events, lead to a sufficient Certainty of Issue, it becomes 
unnecessary for the defendant to be Specific on his Part in his Plea, or to do more than allege Performance 
in General Terms, according to the words of the Condition, leaving the plaintiff in his Replication to Specify the 
Breach that is supposed to have been committed. 


WHAT PARTICULARITY IS GENERALLY REQUIRED 


~9. No greater Particularity is required than the nature of the thing Pleaded will conveniently admit. And when the 
Circumstances Constituting a Cause of Action are so numerous and so minute that the Party pleading is not 
and cannot be acquainted with them, less Certainty is required, and Pleading in General terms is sufficient. 


THE effect of this Rule is that the Certainty required in Pleading Facts does not require a minute and detailed 
Statement of Circumstances which, though material to a Party’s case, he cannot be presumed to know.” Thus, though 
generally, in an Action for injury to goods, the quantity of the goods must be stated, yet if they cannot, under the 
circumstances of the case, be conveniently ascertained by number, weight, or measure, such Certainty will not be 
required. Accordingly, in Trespass for breaking the plaintiff’s close, with beasts, and eating his peas, a Declaration 
not showing the quantity of peas has been held sufficient, “because nobody can measure the peas that beasts can 
eat.” -- So, In an Action on the Case for setting a house on fire, per quod the plaintiff, among divers other goods, 
ornatus pro equis aSs-it, after Verdict for the plaintiff, it was objected that this was Uncertain, but the objection 
was disallowed by the Court. And in this case Windham, 3., said that, if he had mentioned only diversa bona, yet it had 
been well enough, as a man cannot be supposed to know the Certainty of his goods when his house is burnt; and added 
that, to avoid prolixity, the Law will sometimes allow such a Declaration,2’ 


In Actions on Contracts, if the case is one where it is held necessary to Declare Specially on the Contract, great

Particularity are enforced, and the simplest case involves imminent danger of Variance; but if the case admits of the 
use of General Assumpsit or the Common Counts, which are generally applicable wherever money is due for value 
received, no particulars or Facts are required, and the most complicated cases 
may be tried on a bare Claim of Indebtedness.~ 


FACTS IN KNOWLEDGE OF ADVERSARY 


60. Less Particularity is required when the Facts lie more in the knowledge of the Adverse Party than of the Party 
Pleading. 

THIS Rule is exemplified in the case of alleging Title in an Adversary, where a more General Statement is 
allowed than when it is set up in the Party himselt”° 


So, in an Actionof Covenant, the plaintiff Declared that the defendant, by indenture, demised to him certain 
premises, with a Covenant that he (the defendant) had full power and lawful authority to demise the same, 
according to the form and effect of the said indenture; and then the plaintiff assigned a Breach, that the Defendant 
had not full power and lawful authority to demise the said premises, according to the form and effect of the said 
indenture. After Verdict for the plaintiff, it was Assigned for Error that he had not in his Declaration shown “what 
person had right, title, estate, or interest in the

lands demised, by which it might appear to the Court that the defendant had not full power and lawful authority to 
demise.” But, “upon conference and debate amongst the Justices, it was resolved that the Assignment of the Breach 
of Covenant was good; for he had followed the words of the Covenant negatively, and it lies more properly in the 
knowledge of the lessor what estate he himself has in the land which he demises than the lessee, who is a stranger to 
it.” 30 So, where the defendant had covenanted that he would not carry on the business of a rope maker, or make 
cordage for any person, except under Contracts for Government, and the plaintiff, in an Action of Covenant, As- 
signed for Breach that, after the making of the indenture, the defendant carried on the business of a rope maker, and 
made cordage for divers and very many persons, other than by virtue of any Contract for Government, etc., the 
defendant Demurred Specially, on the ground that the plaintiff “had not disclosed any and what particular person 
or persons for whom the defendant made cordage, nor any and what particular quantities or kinds of cordage the 


defendant did so make for them, nor in what manner nor by what acts he carried on the said business of a rope

maker, as is alleged in the said Breach of Covenant.” But the Court held “that, as the Facts alleged in these Breaches 
lie more properly in the knowledge of the defendant, who must be presumed conusant of his own dealings, than of 
the plaintiff’s, there was no occasion to state them with more particularity,” and gave Judgment accordingly.”

Terms. 


inducement and Gravamen 

WHENEVER a bare statement of the Facts constituting the Cause of Action does not show the Right of 
Action with sufficient Certainty, the Facts necessary to explain them must be shown. This preliminary statement is 
called the “Inducement”. It does not enter into the statement of the Cause of Action proper, but is merely ex- 
planatory of such statement, and it does not require the same Certainty.” 


The term “Inducement” is sometimes applied to those Allegations showing the existence of a Right on the part of 
the plaintiff and a Duty on the part of defendant. The Allegations showing the wrongful acts of the 
defendant in violation of the Right and Duty are known as the Gist or Gravamen of the Action. 


As “Matter of Inducement,” as the term is generally used, is that which is merely introductory to or explanatory 
of the essential ground of the Complaint or Defense, and “Matter of Aggravation” such as is alleged only to 
show, in Actions for forcible injuries, for instance, circumstances of enormity under which the wrong complained 
of was committed, neither constitutes a Material Fact essential to Recovery or Defense, and either, therefore, is 
sufficiently met by an Answer to that which forms the Gist of the Action; 


32. “Inducement,” In Pleading, is the Statement of Matter which is Introductory to the Principal Subject of the Declaration or Plea and which 
is necessary to elucidate or explain it. Varnes v. Seaboard Air Line Railway Co., SO Flu, 624, 86 So. 433 (1920). 


The “Inducement” of a Pleading is but an Explanatory Introduction to the Main Allegation In which the Cause of Action Is alleged. 
McDonald v. Hall, 203 Mich. 431, 170 N.W. 68 (1918). 


and, as they require no distinct Answer, a General Mode of Stating them is sufficient.” This Rule is exemplified 
in the case of the Derivation of Title, where, though it is a General Rule that thc Commencement of a Particular 


Estate must be shown, yet an exception is allowed if the title be alleged by Way of Inducement only. So, in 
Assumpsit, the plaintiff declared that in consideration that, at the defendant’s request, he had given and granted 
to him, by deed, the next avoidance of a certain Church, the defendant promised to pay £100, but the 
Declaration did not set forth any Time or Place at which such grant was made. Upon this being objected in Arrest of 
Judgment after Verdict the Court resolved that “it was but an Inducement to the Action, and therefore needed not to be so 
precisely alleged,” and gave Judgment for the plaintiff.“ So, in Trespass, the plaintiff declared that the defendant 
broke and entered his dwelling house, and “wrenched and forced open, or caused to be wrenched and forced open, the 
clpset doors, drawers, chests, cupboards, and cabinets of the said plaintiff.” Upon Special Demurrer it was objected 
that the number of closet doors, drawers, chests, cupboards, and cabinets was not specified. But ft was answered 
“that the breaking and entering the plaintiff's house was the principal ground and foundation of the present action, and 
all the rest are not foundations of the action, but matters only thrown in to Aggravate the Damages, and, on that 
ground, need not be particularly specified.” And of that opinion

ACTS REGULATED BY STATUTE 


CL With respect to Acts Valid at Common Law, hut regulated as to the Mode of Performance, by Statute, it is sufficient 
to use such Certainty of Allegation as was sufficient before the Statute. Thus, a Party Pleading a Contract, Valid by Parol 
at Common Law, but which a subsequent Statute requires to be in Writing, need not allege it to be in Writing. 


THE only explanation necessary to be made of this Rule is that, as matters are to be Pleaded according to their Legal 
Effect, a Statute does not, in regulating the Mode of Performance of an Act, necessarily prescribe a corresponding 
method of Pleading it, unless the thing to be pleaded is one created by the Statute itself. If, therefore, an act Valid at 
Common Law is subsequently required by a Statute to be in writing, it may still be Pleaded as at Common Law 
without alleging writing.” Thus, by the Common Law, a lease for any number of years might be made by parol only; but, 
by the Statute of Frauds, all leases and terms for years made by parol, and not put into writing and signed by the lessors, 
or their agents authorized by writing, shall have only the effect of leases at will, except leases not exceeding the term 
of three years from the making. Yet, in a Declaration of Debt for rent on a demise, it was held sufficient, as it was at Common 
Law, to state a demise for any number of years, without

showing it to have been in writing3~ So, in the ease of a Promise to Answer for the Debt, Default, or Miscarriage 
of another person, which was good by paro], at Common Law, but by the Statute of Frauds, is not valid unless the 
agreement, or some memorandum or note thereof, be in writing, and signed by the party, etc, the Declaration on 
such promise need not allege a written Contract. 


On this subject the following difference is to be remarked, namely, that “where a thing is originally made by Act 
of Parliament, and required to be in writing, it must be Pleaded with all the circumstances required by the act; as in 
the case of a will of lands, it must be alleged to have been made in writing; but where an act makes writing 
necessary to a matter where it was not so at the Common Law, as where a lease for a longer term than three years 
is required to be in writing by the Statute of Frauds, it is not necessary to Plead the thing to be in writing, though it 
must be proved to be so, in Evidence.” ~ 


As to the Rule under consideration, however, a distinction has been taken between a Declaration and a Plea; and 
it is said that though, in the former, the plaintiff need not show the thing to be in writing, in the latter the defendant 
must, Thus, in an Action of Indebtitatus Assumpsit, for necessaries provided for the defendant’s wife, the defendant 
Pleaded that before the Action was brought the plaintiff and defendant and one 
J. B., the defendant’s son, entered into a certain agreement, by which the plaintiff, in discharge of the Debt 
mentioned in the Declaration, was to accept the said 3. B. as her Debtor for £9, to be paid when he should receive 
his pay as a lieutenant, and that the

plaintiff accepted the said 3. B. for her Debtor, etc. Upon Demurrer, Judgment was given for the plaintiff, for two 
reasons: First, because it did not appear that there was any consideration for the agreement; secoiully, that, 
admitting the agreement to be valid, yet, by the Statute of Frauds, it ought to be In writing, or else the plaintiff 
could have no remedy thereon; “and though, upon such an agreement, the plaintiff need not set forth the agreement 
to be in writing, yet, when the defendant Pleads such an Agreement in Bar, he must Plead it so as it may appear 
to the Court that an Action wilt tie upon it, for he shall not take away the plaintiff s present Action, and not give her 
another, upon the agreement Pleaded.” - 


WhAT MAY BE OMITTED—MATTERS 
JUDICIALLY NOTICED 


63. It is not necessary to state matters of which the Court takes Judicial Notice. Matters Judicially Noticed may be 
either of Law or Facts of a Public or General Nature. 


CERTAIN matters may be omitted. Thus it is not necessary to state in the Pleading Matters of which the Court 
will take Judicial Notice.” It is therefore unnecessary to state Matter of Law, for this the Judges are bound 
to know, and can apply for themselves to the Facts aileged. Thus, where it was Stated in a Pleading that an 
officer of a corporation was removed for misconduct, by the corporate body at large, it was held unnecessary to 
Aver that the power of removal was vested in such corporate body, because 
that was a power by Law incident to them, uniess given by some charter, by-law, or other authority, to a 
select part only.” The Rule is not limited to the principles of the Common Law. Public Statutes fall within 


4°. Case v. Barber, T.Raym. 450, 83 Eng.Bep. 235 (1803). 
IL. To this effect, see Comyn’s Digest, Pleader,” C, 78 (1822).

the same reason and the same Rule. Public Domestic Statutes and the Facts which they recite or state must be 
Noticed by the Courts of the Particular State, as well as the Public Acts of Congress, without their being Stated in 
Pleadings; ~ and it is only necessary to allege Facts which will appear to the Court 

to be affected by the Statute,“ though in case of an offense created by Statute, where a penalty is inflicted, the mere 
Statement of the Facts constituting the offense will be in~ sufficient without an express reference to the Statute, 
showing the intention to being the case within it.” Private Acts, however, are not Judicially Noticed, and therefore 
such parts of them as may be material to the Action or Defense, must be Stated in Pleading,*° and Foreign Statutes, as 
those of other States, must also be Pleaded.*” 


It may be observed, however, that, though it is in general unnecessary to allege Matter 
of Law, yet there is sometimes occasion to make mention of it, for the convenience or intelligibility of the Statement 
of Fact. Thus, in an Action of Assumpsit on a Bill of Exchange, the Form of the Declaration is to state that the 
Bill was drawn or accepted by the defendant, etc., according to the nature of the case, and that the defendant, 
as drawer or acceptor, etc., became liable to pay;

and being so liable, in consideration thereof promised to pay. So, as stated above, it is sometimes necessary to 
refer to a Public Statute in General Terms, to show that the case is intended to be brought within the Statute; as, for 
example, to allege that the defendant committed a certain act against the Form of the Statute in such case made and 
provided; but the reference is made in this general way only, and there is no need 
to set the Statute forth. 


This Rule, by which Matter of Law is omitted in the Pleadings, by no means prevents the attainment of the 
requisite Certainty of Issue; for, even though the dispute between the Parties should turn upon Matter of Law, 
yet they may evidently obtain a sufficiently Specific Issue of that description without any Allegation of Law; for ex 
facto jus oritur, that is, every Question of Law necessarily arises out of some given state of Facts; and therefore 
nothing more is necessary than for each Party to state, alternately, his case in point of Fact; and upon Demurrer to the 
sufficiency of some one of these Pleadings, the Issue of Law, as we have heretofore shown, must at length arise. 


Besides Points of Law, there are man)’ other matters of a public kind, of which the Court takes Official Notice, and 
with respect to which it is, for the same reason, unnecessary to make Allegation in Pleading, such as matters 
antecedently alleged in the same Record,IS the Time and Place of holding Congress, or the State Legislature, the 
Time of its Sessions, and its usual course of proceeding, the course of the almanac, the division of the state into 
Counties, the meaning of English words, and terms of art; legal weights and measures, and the ordinary 
moasurement of time, matters of public his- 
tory, affecting the whole people, and many other matters.*° 


MATTERS IN ANTICIPATION 


64. It is not necessary to State Matter which would come more properly from the other side. As it is sufficient for each 
Party to make out 


his own Case or Defense, he adequately sup~ 


ports his Charge or Answer, for the purpose of Pleading, if such Pleading establish a prima facie case in his favor, and 
is not bound to anticipate matter which his Adversary may be at liberty to Plead against him. EXCEPTION 
—Pleadings in Estoppel and Dilatory Pleas must meet and remove, by anticipation, every possible Answer. 


THE ordinary Form of this Rule, namely, that it is not necessary to State Matters which would come more 
properly from the other side, does not fully express its meaning. The meaning is that it is not necessary to 
anticipate the answer of the adversary, or, as it is generally expressed, when reference is made to the Declaration 
only, it is not necessary to anticipate Defenses.M This, ac

cording to Hale, C. 3., is “like leaping before one comes to the stile.” ~ It is sufficient that Each Pleading should, in 
itself, contain a good prima fade case, without reference to possible objections not yet urged. Thus, in Pleading a 
devise of land by force of the Statute of Wills, it is sufficient to allege that such a one was seised of the land in fee, 
and devised it by his last will, in writing, without Alleging that such devisor was of full age. For, though the Statute 
provides that wills made by fernes covert, or persons within age, etc., shall not be taken to be effectual, yet, if the 
devisor were within age, it is for the other Party to show this in his Answer, and it need not be Denied by 
anticipationA~ So, in a Declaration of Debt upon a Bond, it is unnecessary to allege that the defendant was of full 
age when he executed it.~ So, where an Action of Debt was brought upon a Statute against the bailiff of a town for 
not returning the plaintiff, a burgess of that town, for the last Parliament, the words of the Statute being that the 
Sheriff shall send his precept to the Mayor, and, if there be no Mayor, then to the bailiff, the plaintiff declared that the 
Sheriff had made his precept unto the bailiff, without Averring that there was no Mayor. And, after Verdict for the 
plaintiff, this was moved in Arrest of Judgment. But the Court was of opinion, clearly, that the Declaration was 
good, “for we shall not intend that there was a Mayor except it be showed; and, if there were one, it should come more 
properly on the other side.” M So, where there was a Covenant in a charter party ‘that no claim should be admitted,

lowanee made for short tonnage, unless such short tonnage were found and made to appear on the ship’s arrival, on 
a survey to be taken by four shipwrights, to be indifferently chosen by both Parties,” and in an Action of Covenant, 
brought to recover for short tonnage, the plaintiff had a Verdict, the defendant Moved in Arrest of Judgment, that it 
had not been Averred in the Declaration that a survey was taken, and short tonnage made to appear. But the Court 
held that, if such survey had not been taken, this was Matter of Defense, which ought to have been shown by the 
defendants, and refused to Arrest the Judgment.~ 


But where the Matter is Such that its Affirmation or Denial is essential to the apparent or prima facie right of the 
Party Pleading, then it ought to be Affirmed or Denied by him in the first instance, though it may be such as would 
otherwise properly form the subject of objection on the other side. 


MATTERS IMPLIED 


65. It is not necessary to allege Circumstances Necessarily Implied. Necessary Circumstances implied by Law 
from Facts alleged are Traversable without being Pleaded, and need not therefore be alleged. 


A FOURTH subordinate Rule is that it is not necessary to allege Circumstances Necessarily Implied from Facts 
that are alleged.” The reason of this Rule seems to be that as the Law will always Imply Certain Facts from the 
Statement of Others, and the Issue tendered by the Allegation of such Primary Facts alone is therefore sufficient for 
a Traverse by the Adverse Party, so the Facts thus to be implied need no Express Allegation to render the statement 
of the case complete on either side. Thus, in an Action

of Debt on a Bond, conditioned to stand to and perform the Award of W.R., the defendant Pleaded that Wit, made 
no Award. The plaintiff Replied that after the making of the Bond, and before the time for making the Award, the 
defendant, by his certain writing, revoked the authority of the said W.R., contrary to the form and effect of the said 
condition. Upon Demurrer it was held that this Replication was good, without Averring that W.R. had notice of the 
Revocation, because that was implied in the words “revoked the authority,” for there could be no Revocation 
without notice to the arbitrator; so that, if W.R. had no Notice, it would have been competent to the defendant to 
Tender Issue “that he did not revoke in manner and form as alleged.” m So, if a feoffment be Pleaded, it is not 
necessary to allege livery of seisin, for it is implied in the word “enfeoffed.” ~ So, if a man Plead that he is heir to 
A., he need not allege that A. is dead, for it is implied.” 


MATTERS PRESUMED 


66. It is not necessary to allege what the Law will presume. As legality in the transactions or conduct of persons is 
always presumed, everything is regarded as legally done until the contrary is shown. 


TFIUS, it is an Intendment of Law that a person is innocent of fraud, as well as free from every imputation 
against his character, and one insisting on the contrary must both Plead and Prove it.” So the performance of an act 
is presumed where the omission would render one criminally liable, and the burden of alleging and proving the 
negative is on the party who asserts it.” Thus, in

Debt on a Replevin Bond, the plaintiffs declared that at the City of C., and within the Jurisdiction of the Mayor of the 
City, they distrained the goods of W.H. for rent, and that W,H., at the said City, made his Plaint to the Mayor, etc. 
and prayed deliverance, etc., whereupon the Mayor took from him and the defendant the Bond on which the Action 
was brought, conditioned that W.H. should appear before the Mayor or his Deputy at the next Court of Record of the 
City, and there prosecute his Suit, etc., and thereupon the Mayor Replevied, etc. It was held not to be necessary to 
allege in this Declaration a custom for the Mayor to grant Replevin and take Bond, and show that the Plaint was 
made in Court, because all these Circumstances must be presumed against the defendant, who executed the Bond 
and had the benefit of the Replevin.” So, in an Action for Slander imputing theft, the plaintiff need not Aver that he 
is not a thief, because the Law presumes his innocence till the contrary be shown.” 


SURPLUSAGE 
67. Surplusage is to be avoided. The Perfection of Pleading is to combine the requisite Certainty and Precision with 
the greatest possible brevity of statement. “Surplusage,” as 
the term is used in the present Rule, includes matter of any description which is unnecessary to the maintenance of 
the Action or Defense. The Rule requires the omission of such matter in two instances: 


(I) When the matter is wholly foreign and irrelevant to the Merits of the Case; and 


Page 154 of 735 


(II) When, though not wholly foreign, such matter need not be stated. 


THE term “Surplusage,” as used in this chapter, is taken in the broad sense of including all unnecessary matter, 
whether its

Sec. 67

irrelevancy arises from the Nature of the Matter itself, as where it is wholly foreign and impertinent to the case, 
and may therefore be Stricken Out on Motion, as where a plaintiff, suing upon one of the Covenants in a long Deed, 
sets out in his Declaration, not only the Covenant on which he sues, but all the other Covenants, though relating to 
matters wholly irrelevant to the Cause; «sor in the Pleading Matter that, while relevant to the case, the Pleader is 
under no necessity of stating, such as Matter of Evidence, things Judicially Noticed, Matters Implied, etc., which fall 
within the Various Rules heretofore explained as tending to limit or qualify the Degree of Certainty. In either case 
it is a fault to be avoided, as not only tending to cause prolixity in the Pleadings, but also frequently affording an 
advantage to the Opposite Party, by providing him with an objection on the ground of Variance, or by compelling 
the Party Pleading to adduce more Evidence than would otherwise have been necessary. It is therefore of the utmost 
importance to avoid both the statement of unnecessary facts and the Allegation of Facts which, though they may be 
relevant, are not essential to a Proper Statement of the Claim or Defense.°? 


If the matter stated be wholly foreign and impertinent, so that no Allegation on the subject was necessary, it does 


not vitiate the Pleading, the maxim being that “utile, per inutile, non vitkztur’ nor does it require proof, but it will 
be entirely rejected.°° If,

however, a Party take it upon himself to state the Particular Facts of a Claim where a General Allegation only is 
sufficient, he is often bound to prove all items as stated, tinder penalty of a Variance; the Rule being well 
established that matter, though unnecessarily alleged, must be proved if it is descriptive of that which is essential.” 
Again, if Material Matter is alleged with an unnecessary detail of circumstances, the essential and non-essential 
parts of the statement may be so interwoven as to expose the Allegation to a Traverse, and the Pleader to an increased 
Burden of Proof with its consequent additional danger of failure. So it is a Material Part of the Rule respecting 
Superfluous Allegations that if the Party introducing them show, on the Face of his own Pleading, that he has no 
Cause of Action, the Pleading will necessarily be defective.”

we have just seen, it does not Vitiate the Pleading. Where, however, inconsistency or discrepancy on the Face of the 
Record is created by Surplus Allegations, this fault is to be taken advantage of by Special Demurrer)’ 


DESCRIPTIVE AVERMENTS 


68. Every Descriptive Averment, though made with Unnecessary Particularity, must be proved as laid, or it will be a 
fatal Variance. 


THE harsh Rule by which the Courts punish a Party who Pleads Immaterial Facts by compelling him to prove 
them literally as alleged, although they need never have been set out to state the Cause of Action is shockingly 
illustrated in negligence cases. New Trials have frequently been granted for Want of Proof of wholly Unnecessary 
allegations. The Pleader has to steer his course between Scylla and Charybdis, and is driven to state his case in a 
confusing variety of Counts, which multiply and complicate the Issues. He has to learn just how General he may 
make his Allegations, avoiding all unnecessary detail, on the one hand, and the danger of stating mere Conclusions 
of Law or Fact, on the other. By Unnecessary Particularity in a descriptive statement, he binds himself to prove this 
Surplusage in addition to the essential Facts of the case. Yet it is recognized that Averments of Mere Surplusage, 
which are not “matter of description,” are immaterial and need not be proved.” Thus, where a plaintiff, in Action for

The Pleader should ascertain what are the vital elements of his Action or Defense, and then examine the decisions of his own state to lean just 
how general he may make his Allegations; for he is above all to avoid unnecessary detail. As we have already seen, by unnecessarily 


particularizing In a descriptive Allegation he binds himself to prove these unnecessary particulars In addition to the essential Facts of 
the descmiption. Thus, In an Action on the 


Personal Injuries against the railroad, alleged that at the time of the injury she was standing at the intersection of a 
street and the main tracks of the defendant’s railroad, the Court expressed the opinion that it would be a material 
Variance if the Proof showed that she was then standing twenty-five or thirty feet from this point.’* But the precise 
place where the personal injury occurs is not ordinarily an element in the Cause of Action, and it is sufficient to state 
the County in which the injury took place.” It is not necessary for a passenger, who is suing a railroad for injuries, to 
state the termini between which he was being carried; but, if he does state them, the Allegations will require strict 


Page 156 of 735 


Proof.” These decisions are placed on the ground that the great object of a Declaration is to notify the defendant of 
the nature and character of the plaintiff’ s demand, so that he may be able to prepare for a Defense. 


If, however, the Pleader make his Allegations of particulars under a videlicet, that the injury occurred on a 
certain day, v4z., on March 1, 1916, then the Count will not limit the plaintiff to the precise day alleged, but admits 
Proof that the injury occurred at any time within the period of the Statute of Limitations.” There is equal notice in 
either event, whether the “Viz” is used or not. 


Cage, where the defendant might have been liable as owner of certain premises, and the Declaration Averred that be was the “owner and 
occupier” of certain premises, Proof tending to show liability as owner alone was held inadmissible.

REPUGNANCY 
14~ 

In Span gler v. Pugh,” where a note was received in Evidence, and the amount of the note was a half cent 
larger than the amount alleged in the Declaration, this was held a fatal error in Matter of Substance. The Illinois 
Supreme Court, although regretting that such a trifling slip should delay a Party in the Administration of Justice, 
sent the plaintiff back for a New Trial, in order that the Science of Common-Law Pleading might not be impaired. In 
another case, the difference between the instrument described and that offered in Evidence of a dollar mark after the 
amount a the subscription was held a fatal Variance, although the body of the contract showed what was 
intended. 


If the plaintiff had declared on the Indebitatus Counts, he might have proved the execution of the instrument and 
established the indebtedness without any details at all. In an Action of Assumpsit upon a note alleged in the 
Declaration to have been executed by “Wiffiam” Becker, the plaintiff offered at the Trial a note signed by “Wilhelm” 
Becker. This was admitted in Evidence over Objection and the Judgment for plaintiff was Reversed for Variance.” 


REPUGNANCY 


69. A Pleading is bad for Repugnancy when it contains Contradictory or Inconsistent Allegations, which destroy or 
neutralize each other. There is an Exception to this Rule when the Allegation creating the fault is Superfluous. 


REPUGNANCY is a fault in all Pleading, and the reason of the rule is clearly apparent,

since, where the Declaration or Other Pleading alleges matter which either contradicts or is inconsistent with matter 
previously alleged in the same Pleading, there can be, on the Party’s own showing, neither a legal Cause of Action nor a 
Defense.°° Thus, where, in an Action of Trespass, the plaintiff declared for taking and carrying away certain timber, 
lying in a certain place, for the completion of a house then lately built, this declaration was considered as bad for 
Repugnancy, for the timber could not be for the building of a house already built.” So, where the defendant Pleaded 
a grant of a rent, out of a term of years, and proceeded to allege that, by virtue thereof, he was seized in his demesne, 


Page 157 of 735 


as of freehold, for the term of his life, the Plea was held bad for Repugnancy.*” Where the Repugnancy is in a 
material point, it Vitiates the Pleading, which is ill on Special Demurrer.*’ When, however, the Allegation creating 
the Repugnancy is merely Superfluous and redundant, so that it may be rejected from the Pleading without 
materially altering the general sense and effect, it is to be disregarded or Stricken

Out on Motion, and will not Vitiate the Pleading; for the maxim is “Utile, per mutile, non vitiatur.”®’ 


AMBIGUITY OR DOUBT 


70. Pleadings must not be Ambiguous or Doubtful in Meaning; and, when two different meanings present themselves, 
that construction shall be adopted which is most unfavorable to the Pleader. Ambiguity in Pleading occurs where the 
matter alleged may have several meanings; but a Pleading is not objectionable on this ground if it be clear enough for its 
true meaning to be ascertained, according to reasonable intendment or construction, though not worded with absolute 
precision. 


THE Pleader must avoid stating the matter of his Claim or Defense in such a manner as to render it so Doubtful 
or Obscure that, upon its face, it will be uncertain what he means to allege.” Thus, if, in Trespass quare clausuni 
fregit, the defendant Pleads that the locus in quo was his freehold, he must allege that it was his freehold at the 
time of the Trespass; otherwise, the Plea is insufficient. So, in Debt on a Bond, conditioned to make assurance of 
land, if the defendant Pleads that he executed a release, his Plea is bad if it does not express that the release concerns 
the same land. 


In determining which of two meanings that present themselves shall be adopted, that construction is given that is 
most unfavorable to the Party Pleading, since it is presumed that every person states his case

as favorably as possible for himself.** This Rule, however, is always subject to this quaiification, namely, that when 
an expression is capable of different meanings, the one which will support the Pleading is to be taken rather than the 
one which will defeat it.*°

another, the Pleading must state that one was performed, and specify which one.

defendant, in a case where he is required to perform Several Affirmative Acts, to Plead Generally the due 
performance of all »2, if the acts imposed are in the Alternative or Disjunctive, such a General Plea will be Am- 
biguous and improper, since it would riot enable the Court to determine which of the acts had been done, and No 
Definite Issue would be formed. The Plea must therefore show the performance of one of the acts, and also clearly 
point out which one was completed. Thus, in an Action of Debt against a jailer for the escape of a prisoner, where 
the defendant Pleaded that if the said prisoner did, at any time or times after the said commitment, etc., ~o at large 
he so escaped without the knowledge of the defendant, and against his will, and that, if any such escape was made, 
the prisoner voluntarily returned into custody before the defendant knew of the escape, etc., the Court held the Plea 
bad, for “he cannot Plead Hypothetically that, if there has been an escape, there has also been a return. He must 
either stand upon an Averment that there has been no escape, or that there have been one, two, or ten escapes, after 
which the prisoner returned.” - So, where it was charged that the defendant wrote and published, or caused to be 
written and published, a certain libel, this was considered as bad for uncertainty.M

Alternative or Hypothetical pleading is a Defect in Form, objectionable on Special Demurrer only.” 


DUPLICITY IN GENERAL 


72. Duplicity, or Double Pleading, consists in alleging two or more distinct grounds of Complaint or Defense for a single 
object, when one only would be sufficient. The fault may exist in, and the Rule therefore applies to 


(D The Declaration; and 
(ID) The Subsequent Pleadings. 


THE requirement of the Common Law that Pleadings shall not be Double has for its object the Attainment of the 
Singleness or Unity of the Issue between the Parties, which it is the aim of all Pleadings to produce. It precludes both 
plaintiff and defendant, in their respective Pleadings, from stating or relying upon more than one matter, 
constituting a sufficient Ground of Action in respect to the Same Demand, or an effective Defense to the same 
Claim, or an adequate Answer to the Preceding Pleading of the opponent.°° The Rule in its terms points to 


~ Oglethorp v, Hyde, Cro.Eliz, 233, 78 Eng.Bep. 488 (1594); Hodgeon v. East India Co., S TB. 280, 101 Eng,Rep. 1389 (1799); Taylor v. 
Needham, 2 Taunt, 278, 127 Eng.Rep. 1084 (1810). 


Cases arise where the plaintiff is uncertain against which of several persons he Is entitled to relief, as where several corporations operate a line of 
track, or where a defendant may have been acting either as an agent or as a principal. In such cases some Modern Rules of Procedure allow the 
plaintiff to join any or all of them as defendants in the alternative. It is also deemed convenient under Modern Rules to allow a Party to include 
in his Pleading two or more alternative sets of Material Facts. even tbough inconsistent, and to claim Belief thereunder in the alternative, 
upon an alternative construction or ascertainment of his Cause of Action, without the necessity of making an election.

Doubleness only, as if it prohibited only the use of Two Allegations or Answers; but its meaning, of course, 
extends equally to the case of more than two, the term “Doubleness” or “Duplicity” being applied, though with some 
inaccuracy, to either case. The effect of the Rule is thus to avoid confusion and a multiplication of Issues in the 
Action, and it is in all cases founded on the principle that it would be unnecessary and vexatious to cause the 
Adverse Party to litigate and prove two or more Facts or Propositions, when one alone would sufficiently establish 
the Matter in dispute, 


Page 160 of 735 


Duplicity in a Declaration consists in joining, in one and the same Count, different Grounds of Action to enforce 
a single Right of Recovery.” This is a Fault in Form, because it tends to prolixity and confusion and a Multiplicity 
of Issues.

breaches of duty. Laporte v. Cook, 20 RI. 261, 38 A. 700 (1897). 
INDUCEMENT 


73. No Matter will operate to make a Pleading flouble that is Pleaded only as Necessary Inducement to another 
Allegation. 


THUS, it may be Pleaded, without Duplicity, that after the Cause of Action accrued the plaintiff (a woman) took a 
husband, and that the husband afterwards released the defendant; for though the eoverthre is itself a Defense, as 
well as the release, yet the Averment of the coverture is a necessary introduction to that of the release.” This Ex- 
ception to the Genera] Rule is prescribed by an evident principle of Justice; for the Party has a Right to Rely on any 
single matter that he pleases, in preference to another, as, in this instance, on the release in preference to the 
coverture. But if a Necessary Inducement to the matter on which he relies, when itself amounting to a Defense, 
were held to make his Pleading Double, the effect would be to exclude him from this right, and compel him to rely 
on the Inducement only. 


CONSEQUENCES OF DUPLICITY 


74. Duplicity is a Fault in Form, and can only be objected to by Special Demurrer. 


THIS Rule results necessarily from the Nature of the Fault, which is not in the Substance of the Matter Pleaded, 
but in the Statement of Matter in excess of what is necessary to constitute a valid Claim, or Answer. Being thus a 
Defect only in Form, advantage must be taken of it, under the Statute of Elizabeth, only by Special Demurrer, in 
which the particular Duplicity must be 


93. Bacon’s Abr., “Pleas” etc. K,2 (London, 1778); Comyn’s Dig., “Pleader” E.2 (Dublin, 1793). 


A. Plea by an Executrix in Abatement was not subject to the charge of Duplicity In Alleging the Facts showing that the Action did not survive 
against defendant as Executor; where, if the Action survived, those Facts were necessary under the Illinois Abatement Act, § 25, to 
make the plea good. Genmill v. Smlth, 274 Ii]. 87, 113 N.E. 27 (1910). 

clearly pointed out.°° If the Party Demur Generally, the objection cannot afterwards be raised. Where the Opposite 

Party, Instead of Demurring to a Pleading which contains two distinct and sufficient Matters, improperly joined, 

Pleads Over instead, the weight of authority seems to be that he must answer both Matters, or the one passed over 

will remain decisive against him." In such case, an Answer to each Matter, single in itself, does not constitute 

Duplicity; but it must still be remembered that each Separate Answer, as to its own Allegations, is subject to the 


Page 161 of 735 


full operation of the Rule. 


The Rule requiring the Demurrer for Duplicity to be Special, finds no application in the case of Misjoinder of 
Causes of Action, since a plaintiff who joins in the same Declaration different Counts, containing separate and 
incongruous Causes of Action, as distinct Grounds of Recovery, commits a radical Fault, and his Declaration is bad, 
either on General Demurrer or in Arrest of Judgment or on Writ of Error.” 

2. Alabama: Pharr v. Bachelor, $ Ala. 237 (1841); 

Illinois: McGinnity v. Laguerenne, 5 Gil. (III.) 101

New York: Cooper r. Bissell, 10 Jobns. (N.Y.) 140 
(1819). 


But a Demurrer for Misjoinder must be to thc Whole Declaration, and not merely to the Defective Count or Breach. IUngdoin v. Nottle, 1 
Maine & S. 355, 105 Engllep. 133 (1818); Fernald v. Garvin, 511 Me. 


414 (1867). And the plaintiff cannot, If a Demurrer is Interposed, Aid his Mistake by entering a Nolls Prosequi, so as to prevent the 
operation of the Be. 


PLEADINGS TO BE TRUE 


75. Every Pleading should state only such Facts as are True and Capable of Proof, avoiding False and Frivolous 
Allegations tending to deceive the Court and the Adversary, and to delay the progress of the Trial. 


AT Common Law, while it is a principle that Pleadings ought to be true, yet there are no means of enforcing the 
Rule. Thus the Common-Law Pleadings fail to uncover the Real Issues in dispute. The Illinois Practice Act (Section 
52) made provision that the Denial of the Execution or Assignment of an Instrument in Writing, when a copy is filed 
with the Pleading, must be Verified by Affidavit. The Illinois Practice Act (Section 55) gave the plaintiff the option 
in Actions on Contract for the payment of money to file an Affidavit as to the amount due, and thereby require the 
defendant to file with his Plea an Affidavit of Merits which must specify the Nature of the Defense. The purpose of 
this is to give the plaintiff notice of the Real Defense to be presented and to limit the Issues to be tried. 


It is usually provided in Reformed Systems of Pleading that the plaintiff may Verify his Complaint, and then the 
Denials of the Answer must be Specific, and must also be made Under Oath with the Penalties of Perjury for 
Falsehood. This requires the defendant to put in Issue only the Points on which he means to Rely. Thus, in a 
Suit on a Fire Insurance Policy, there may be no dispute as to the Execution of the Contract sued on; but the company 
may expect to avoid liability by showing in Defense some Excuse, such as Breach of Warranty by the insured.

DECLARATION—MANNER OF PLEADING 
Ch. 6 
which the proof might be difficult for the plaintiff to obtain and produce.” 


CONFORMANCE TO CUSTOMARY FORMS 
76. Pleadings should observe the known and ancient expressions as contained in approved 
precedents. When there has been a long.estab. 
lished Form of Pleading, containing Allegations of Frequent and Ordinary Occurrence applicable to the Facts of a 
Particular Case, it should in general be adopted for the sake of Uniformity and Certainty. 


THIS Rule is not to be taken as an imperative one, except in certain cases where precise technical expressions or 
terms are required to be used. At the same time it is safer to follow approved precedents, otherwise there is danger of 
omitting an Averment which might, on account of precedent, be considered essential to the particular Pleading. 


The General Issues are examples of forms 

of expression, fixed by ancient usage, from which it is improper to depart. And another illustration of this Rule 
occurs in the following English case: To an Action on the Case, the defendants Pleaded the Statute of Limitations, 
namely, “that they were Not Guilty within six years,” etc. The Court decided, upon Special Demurrer, that this Form 
of Pleading was bad, upon the ground that “from the passing of the Statute to the present case the invariable Form of 
Pleading the Statute to an Action on the Case for a wrong has been to allege that the Cause of Action 


3. Bliss, Code Pleadings §~ 135, 422. See Higgins Carpet Co. v. Latimer, 165 Pa. 617, 30 At!. 1050 (1895); English order 21, rule 9. By the rules 
33 of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, Allegations and Denials, made without reasonable cause and found untrue, subjected the Party 


Pleading them to the payment of such reasonable expenses caused to the Other Party by such Untrue Pleading. 
did not accrue within six years,” etc.; and that “it was important to the Administra~ tion of Justice that the usual and 
established Forms of Pleading should be observed.” 


The Rule stated is of rather uncertain application, for it must be often doubtful whether a given form of 
expression has been so fixed by the course of precedent as to admit of no variation. In a New York case the Lower 
Court held a Declaration in Case for Deceit in the sale of property bad, even after Verdict, because it failed to allege 
the scienter on the part of the defendant in making the sale, which was in accordance with precedent, and was deemed 
essential. “To dispense with the Rule,” said Kent, C. J., “would be a dangerous relaxation, and might lead to the loss of 
Certainty and Precision in Pleading. General Rules will sometimes appear harsh and rigorous in their application to 
particular cases; but I entertain a decided opinion that the established principles of pleading, which compose what is 
called its science, are rational, concise, luminous, and admirably adapted to the investigation of truth, and ought, 
consequently, to be very cautiously touched by the hand of innovation.” ~ On Writ of Error, this decision was 
reversed on the ground that the Defect was Aided or Cured by Verdict.°

which we shall consider the allegations necessary to show liability in the Contract Actions, Debt, Covenant, 
Account, Special Assumpsit and General (Indebitatus) Assumpsit. 


The typical elements or grounds constituting a cause of action differ With the different Forms of Action, whether 
in Tort, Contract or Property. And in Common Law Pleading the Declaration must state a cause of action in the 
particular form or theory of action selected. And, in order to do this, the plaintiff must state facts in his declaration 
that will (1) meet the test of a General Demurrer; and (2) which he can Prove at the Trial; for it will do the pleader 
no good to get by the Shoal of Demurrer if he is going to wreck on the Rock of Variance. 


In Tort Actions 

IN Tort Actions the plaintiff is, in general, to allege and prove merely the nature of the harm and defendant's share in 
causing it. Matters of Justification and Excuse, as self-defense, leave and license, contributory negligence, consent or 
privilege, are put on the defendant to plead and prove, since it is unfair to assume that any of them are present or to 
require the plaintiff to disprove the existence of each. But in Malicious Prosecution the plaintiff must negative 
defendant’s good faith and reasonableness by showing malice and lack of probable cause as part of his prima facie 
case, though in the nature of excuse for the defendant, who is relieved on grounds of public policy, to protect prose- 


Page 164 of 735 


cutors from the burden of attack, which might hamper public justice. In Slander and Libel, on the other hand, the 
plaintiff is relieved from the burden of showing the falsity of the defamatory words, and the defendant must prove 
the truth of his slanderous utterance in defense—a rule well calculated to give a man pause in making slanderous 
statements about his neighbors. 

As the first of the Tort Actions, let us now consider the Action of Trespass, keeping in mind that one of our 
principal considerations is always, what facts must be alleged in order to state a good cause of action? 


SCOPE OF THE ACTION 


77. The Action of Trespass lies for the recovery of Damages for an injury to the person~ property, or relative 
rights of another: 
(D Where the injury was committed with force, actual or implied; 


(IL) Where the injury was immediate, and not merely consequential; 


(IIT) In case of injury to property, where 
the property was in the actual or 
constructive possession of the plain— tiff at the time of the injury. 


THE term “Trespass”, in its broadest sense, includes any offense or voluntary transgression against the law of 
nature, of society, or of the country in which we live, whether such act relates to a person or to his property. In a 
more restricted sense, it. signifies an injury committed with violence, either actual or implied; and the law will imply 
violence though none is actually used, when the injury is of a direct and immediate character, and committed on the 
person or-on the corporeal and tangible property, real or personal, of the plaintiff. Of actual violence, an assault and 
battery is an example; of implied violence, a peaceable but wrong-ful entry upon another’s land.” 


Where, however, the injury was indirect and consequential, the remedy was Trespass on the Case, and here it 
should be observed that the two delictual remedies of Trespass and Trespass on the Case have divided between them 
the entire field of tort; they supplement each other in this respect. In consequence, if Damage occurs as a result of a 
wrongful act or omission other than a breach

ACTLON OF TRESPASS

of contract, Trespass or Case become the accepted remedy,-if the act was of such character as to constitute a wrong 
for which a civil action was available. There were other tort remedies such as Detinue, Replevin and Trover, but, 
broadly speaking, an act was not regarded as a tart except where it was remediable in Trespass or some Form of 
Trespass on the Case.” 


The early history on the Writ of Trespass is of great significance to the legal scholar as the fountain source of our 
law of torts. It was long the only Common Law remedy based on the conception of giving compensation for Damage 
resulting from wrongful acts. And prior to its emergence the law of torts was in a primative and confused state. As 
yet there was no distinction between public and private wrongs, and the rules applicable to crime were yet to be 
formulated into a separate body of law. And this explains why, in its origin, Trespass was dual in character, being Part 
Criminal and Part Civil. Enforcement of such law of torts as existed was left to the Local Courts, of which the 
Written Records are few. When, however, the Writ found its way into the Royal Courts, the Common Law theory of 
tort liability gradually began to take definite form.* 


According to Pollock and Maitland, the Action of Trespass was descended from the old Writ of breve de traits 
gressione; ~ and although in its settled form it was quite uncommon in 1250, it had become common by 1272.6 By 


the reign of Edward I (1272— 3-3 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability; c. XVII, 
The Action of Trespass, 223 (Northport 1906).

1805). 

6. tke recorded Instances of Trespass in the Royal Courts prior to 1252 are very few. In the ‘Abbreviatlo Placitorum’ 
some twenty.flve eases of appeals of different kinds are mentioned, belonging to the perlod 1104—1252, but not a single case of 
Trespass. In the year 37 Henry IN (1252—1253) no fewer than 

1307) the Writ of Trespass had found its Way into the Register of Writs.’ But the authorities have not been in 
agreement as to the origin of the action. Ames, Holmes and Maitland tell us that Trespass originated from the 
Appeal of Felony, which lay far such crimes as homicide, mayhem, rape, wounthn~ and battery, or for property inju- 
ries, such as arson and larceny, or for robbery.® 


Naturally, the earliest wrongs to call for remedy were those committed with force and violence, such as Trespass 
to real estate, accompanied by Damage to the defendant’s goods and chattels,° assault and battery, false 
imprisomnent, or abduction of the plaintiff s wife. By authority of the Writ of Trespass a plaintiff was able to secure 
redress for Damage done to his person, his possession of goods or land, or his domestic relations, by direct physical 
interference. 


A trespass may be committed either upon the person of another, as in the case of assault, assauit and battery, or 
false arrest or imprisonment; or upon his real or personal property, as where a person enters upon another’s land, or 
takes or merely injures his 


twenty-live cases of Trespass are recorded, and from this time on the action is frequent, while appeals are rarely brought.” Amos, Lectures on 
Legal History, Lecture IV, Trespass Dc Bonis AsportaUs, 56 (Cambridge 1913).

Action, Lecture V, 48—SO (Cambridge 1948). 


9. Many of the early eases Involvod a trespass to both real and personal property. In such cases the plaintiff alleged the trespass for, let us say, the 
breaking and entering of the dwelling house, as the principal trespass, and then added the injury to the personal property 
Incidental thereto, as was said, by way of aggravation of damages. For a case involving this point, see Chamberlain v. Greenfield, 
2 WmML 810, 06 Eng.Rep. 476 (1772).

goods; or upon his relative rights, as where a person beats or debauches another’s daughter or servant. All 

trespasses, whether to person, property or relative rights, whether committed with actual or implied force, were and 

are called “trespass vi et armis.” 


As we have seen, a trespass is an injury committed with violence, and this violence may be either actual or 
implied; and the law will imply violence, even though none was actually used, where the injury is of a direct and 
immediate kind, and committed on the persan or the tangible and corporeal property of the plaintiff; :° that is, if the 
injury is direct, and not consequential, the proper remedy to recover damages is by the Action of Trespass.” 


U, however, a tort is committed without force, either actual or implied, or the injury was merely consequential, or 
if, in the case of injury to property, the plaintiff’ s right or interest was only in reversion at the time of the injury, 
Trespass will not lie, and the remedy, as will be seen, must be by an Action on the Case or Trover’”

(1) The technical limits of Trespass to the party in possession, or with the immediate right of 
possession, are probably due to its origin as a semi-criminal action, covering a wrongful 
application of force which might lead to violence and a breach of the peace; 


(2) Possession is to be distinguished from the custody of a servant; and a bailee at will is given the 
rights of a possessor, though for most purposes his possession Is that of the bailor;

(6) Naked possession is sufficient as against a wrongdoer. 
(B) Specifically, the Declaration in Actions of Trespass to 
Property, Real or Personal, or to Relative Rights should: 


(1) State the property or thing

(2) Show such possession, actual or constructive, as is sufficient to sustain the action; 
(3) Describe the property sufficiently for identification, hut the plaintiff’s Title or Interest may be 
generaliy stated. 


Trespass for Personai Injury 

IN Trespass for injury to the person, the Declaration need only contain a statement of the wrongful act- This 
appears to be an exception to the rule that the Declaration in all Forms of Action should contain a Statement of the 
Right of the plaintiff as well as the Violation of that Right by Act of the defendant. But since the right of personal 
security and liberty belong to all, there is no necessity of alleging their existence in the pleading; the court takes 
judicial notice thereof. All that is nece~ary, therefore, is the statement of The wrongful act of the defendant, such as 
an assault and battery, or

IN order to maintain an Action of Trespass for injury to either real” or personal property,” the plaintiff must 
allege, by Way of Title, that he was in actual or constructive possession, at the time the injury occurred. He must have 
actual possession, or the right to immediate possession. If his right was

In Pinch v. Brian, supra, the plaintiff had left meat at the defendant’s house under an agreement for Its sale, and the defendant, after 
consuming a part of It, refused to take and pay for It. The lower Court sustained an Action of Trespass for such consuniption, and, of course, 
on Appeal the Judgment was reversed. 

merely in reversion, his remedy was in Trespass on the Case, not Trespass.’ ° 


A General and Special Property interest 
IT is frequently said that an Allegation of a General or Special Property Interest is sufficient to support an Action 
of Trespass. This is true if properly understood. 


Thus, the general owner of personal property, who parts with custody thereof, does not necessarily part with his 
possession so as to prevent his maintaining Trespass against a stranger. The person who has the absolute or 
general property interest -~ may maintain the action, though, when the injury occurred, he had parted with the 
custody to a carrier, servant, or other agent, where it appears that he gave the latter only a bare authority to carry or 
keep, not coupled with any special interest in the property. And generally, if the owner of .personal property merely 
permits another gratuitously to use it, having a right to retake possession at any time, he may sue a stranger in 
Trespass for an injury done to it while it was so used.’-~ The rule applies equally to an Action of Trespass by a 
bailee who had an authority, coupled with an interest, and a right to irnme

has no possession, actual or constructive.22 While there appears to be no very substantial distinction between the 
custody of a servant and the possession of a depositary at will, nevertheless, the bailee is allowed the p05-sessory 
remedies, but the servant is not. A servant or agent is denied the rights and remedies of a possessor, because his acts 
are the acts of his employer, and hence the rights which he represents are those of his employer.” By an anomaly of 
the Common Law, a subservient bailee, like a depositary for storage, who holds, like a servant, entirely at the orders 
of the bailor, is yet regarded as having legal possession rather than mere custody and hence may sue a trespasser. 


There can hardly be such a thing as possession in law, entitling one to the possessory remedies, without a claim of 
Title, or at least some independent claim of a limited or temporary interest. A tenant at will or a bailee at will has 
possession as against the public in general, though for most purposes his holding is the possession of the owner.

WITH a few exceptions what has been said with reference to alleging Title in Trespass to Personal Property 
applies equally in alleging Title to Real Property. The gist of the action of Trespass guare clausum fregit is the 
injury to the possession, and the general rule is that the plaintiff, in order to maintain the action, must allege that he 
was in actual or constructive possession ~: of the realty at

the time the injury was committed.” As in the case of personal property, if the plaintiff’s right was merely in

jurisdictions it is held that Trespass will lie in such a case by the landlord if the tenant in possession was merely a

in fact was necessary,” and the same ruling has been made in other states.”° 


The mere occupancy of land by a hired servant of the owner, without paying rent, is not possession. In such case 
the possession is said to be constructively or actually in the owner, and he may maintain Trespass as if he had been 
in actual possession himself?” Likewise, the family or servants, the guests or lodgers, of a householder, do not have 
possession, even during the absence of the owner, as there is no claim of title or interest on their part even at the 
time. Their occupation is regarded as entirely subordinate to and in the name of the owner. Possession implies some 
claim of title or independent holding.” A Wisconsin case 32illustrates a questionable failure to apply this doctrine. It 
appeared that B, the defendant, had committed a trespass during the absence of C, the husband of the plaintiff, A. In 
an action by A, the wife, it was held that she had sufficient possession to maintain Trespass, on the theory that she 
was in the exclusive occupation of the premises in the absence of her husband. It is submitted that the court 
overlooked the point that occupancy and residence are not possession, unless under a Claim of Title of some sort. 
The situation of the wife would appear to be like that of

the husband, although this may be rebutted.** 


In England and in some of our states, New York in particular, it was held that the rule that the general ownership 
of property draws to it the possession, applicable to personal property, does not apply to real property; that in the case 
of real property there is no such constructive possession, and hence unless the plaintiff had the actual possession by 
himself or his servant at the time of the injury, he cannot maintain Trespass.”” In most of our states the rule is 
otherwise, and the owner of Land not in the actual possession of another is given the remedies of a possessor.” If no 
one has actual possession, the owner of the Legal Title has constructive possession; but there

Where Land is in the Actual and Lawful Possession of the Wrongdoer—Spec~ficatly the Tenant at Will 

IN some cases Trespass may be maintained for an injury to property, real or personal, while it was in the actual 
and lawful possession of the wrongdoer, for an abuse of his possession may ipso facto terminate his possession in the 
eye of the law, and render him a Trespasser Ab Initio?’ Thus, for example, it has been held that if a tenant at will 
commits waste, his wrongful act terminates the tenancy, possession is restored, and Trespass quare clausuni fregit 
may be maintained against him by the landlord or reversioner.*® 


This is what some of the English and American Courts have held, but is submitted that it is not a realistic 
explanation of what actually happened. At Common Law the Action of Waste was not available against a tenant at 
will Y° When, therefore, a tenant at will committed waste—let us say be chopped down the century old shade trees in 
front of the mansion—the landlord demanded a remedy. There was none at the time as the Action on the Case was 
not yet in being. What happened? They took the Action of Trespass, which in legal theory, was avail

able only for the protection of an actual possessory interest, and stretched it to fill a temporary remedial gap. By his 
wrongful act of destroying the trees, the authorities argued, the tenant terminated the lease at will, restored the 
possession to the landlord, who then proceeded with his Action of Trespass. In reality, even after the wrongful act, 
the tenant at will remained in actual physical possession, and to say that the act restored possession to the landlord 
was a pure fiction—a fiction which continued in operation until the Action of Trespass on the Case came into 
operation as a Remedy for injury to reversionary interests. Somewhat the same sort of development took place when 
Trespass was originally permitted as a remedy in the seduction cases on the theory that the wrongdoer has interfered 
with the master’s possessory interest in his servant, to wit, his daughter. In this instance, as in the tenancy at will, a 
fiction was coupled with the Action of Trespass to bridge a remedial gap, until Case came in as a remedy for the 
indirect consequential injury to the father resulting from the seduction of his daughter.*° 


A Mere Naked Possession as Sufficient Title Against a Wrongdoer 

SINCE the days of the Ancient Real Possessory Actions, or more specifically, since the appearance of the Assize 
of Novel Disseisin, one forcibly ousted from his possession could be summarily restored to his possession. The law 
protected one in possession of real property in order to prevent breaches of the peace. It is not surprising then to find 
that Trespass, being an interference with

the possession, the de facto exercise of dominion over property, does not require a Legal Title to support it. Under 

the early Common Law, if the so-called Title, which was only an older possession, was involved, the remedy was by 

Writ of Right.” 

In consequence of this development, it became e~tablished law that a mere naked possession, without any other Title, is 
sufficient as against a wrongdoer. In the case of Graham v. Peat,” The Court declared: “Any possession is a legal 
possession against a wrongdoer.” Possession is a sufficient Title to the plaintiff in an Action of Trespass vi et armis 
against a wrongdoer; the finder of an article may maintain Trespass against any person but the real owner; and, a 
person having an illegal possession may support this action against any person other than the true owner.” 


A bailee may maintain Trespass against a stranger, or even the general owner, for an injury to the property which is 
$ : ; 44 
in his possession, and, as we have seen, even where

possession. The quantity or certainty of the bailee's interest is immateriaL* Even a mere gratuitous bailee may 
maintain the action against a stranger.*? As we have seen, a person professedly in possession as a mere servant can- 
not maintain Trespass. 


In general, what has been said as to mere naked possession with reference to Trespass to Personal Property 
applies to Real Property. In an Action of Trespass for injury to Real Property, the Title may come into question, but it 
is not essential that it should.“ Actual and exclusive possession without a Legal Title is sufficient against a 
wrongdoer or a person who cannot show any right or authority from the real Owner.** Trespass,

ACTION OF TRESPASS 


163 


Where the plaintiff was not in actual possession, whether the property was real or personal, but relies upon a 
constructive possession to maintain his action, title becomes very material, He must allege such a Title as thaws to it 


the constructive possession. 


He must at least show a right to immediate possession and the absence of adverse possession} ~ 


Where the Property or Right injured is intangible 


WHERE the property or right injured is intangible, that is, not involving possession, the injury can never be 
considered as Trespass, but the remedy must be by an Action on the Case." Trespass will not lie, for instance, for 
obstructing a private right of way, where the oVmer of the right does not own or possess the way itself.” Nor will it 


lie for obstructing a public highway,” or a navigable 


But, if a tenancy at will had been terminated by no. tlce, and the tenant had merely remained in possession, he cannot maintain the action 


against his landlord. Meader v. Stone, 7 Mete (Mass.) 147 (1843); Curl v. Lowell, 19 Pick. (Mass.) 25 (1837). 


It has generally been held that a tenant at sufferance

light and air through ancient windows by an erection on the adjoining land.°° Case and not Trespass is the remedy 
for diversion of or other injury to a water course, or body of water, where the plaintiff is not the owner of the soil, 
but is merely entitled to the use of water.” 


Where the injury is to corporeal property, an Action of Trespass is the proper remedy, notwithstanding the fact 
that the property was the means by which an incorporeal right was enjoyed. Thus, destruction of a dam is a trespass, 
although the dam is the means by which a franchise granted by the legislature is exercised.~ 


Stating the Right of the Plaintiff 

IN Trespass to Lands or Goods, it is necessary to describe the property affected, whether real or personal, and to 
show the plaintiff's Right, Title, Interest or Possession, Thus, the Declaration must allege the property to be the 
plaintiff s, or at least in the plaintiff’s possession. It is sufficient to plead ownership, and under that pleading any 
evidence showing sufficient right and interest to maintain Trespass is enough. Possession alone is all that needs to be 


proved. It will be sufficient to prove Actual Possession without any Title, or Actual Possession Coupled with Title, or Title 
Coupled with

a Right of Immediate Possession. It is suff 1-cient to ‘say that the goods were the goods “of the plaintiff’ or “that he 
was lawfully possessed of them as of his own property.” 63 It is sometimes said that constructive possession is 
sufficient. By constructive possession is meant that a person entitled to possession is treated as if he had actual posses- 
sion, and is given the rights and remedies of a possessor. 


DECLARATION IN TRESPASS—ESSENTIAL 
ALLEGATIONS- (3) THE DEFENDANT’S 
WRONGFUL ACT 

81. The Wrongful Act must be a direct application of force, however slight, something that might cause a breach of 
the peace. The injury must be immediate and not merely consequential upon the defendant’s act. Trespass lies for an 
mmediate and forcible injury to person or property by an intentional or negligent act. 

Trespass will not lie for Malicious Prosecution, nor for acts done under Authority of Process Regularly Issued. 

Trespass will lie for Abuse of Authority of Law, making the wrongdoer a Trespasser Ab Initio. 


The Declaration must state the wrong or injury violating the plaintiff’s right, and must on the face of it show a 
Trespass; that is, an injury committed with Force, Actual or Implied, and an injury that was Direct and Immediate upon 
the defendant’s Act, and not merely Consequential. 


The Elements of Force 
FORCE is either actual or implied. An Assault and Battery,” tearing down a fence and entering upon land, or 
breaking into a house,” or carrying away goods,” are exam-

ples of actual force; and in these cases there is no difficulty in determining that Trespass is the proper remedy for the 
immediate injury resulting from the wrong, if, of course, in the case of the injury to property, real or personal, the 
plaintiff was in actual or constructive possession. 


Force is implied in every Trespass quare clausum fregit. If a man goes upon another’s land without right, 
however peaceably or thoughtlessly, the law will imply force, and trespass will lie. And the same is true if a man’s 
cattle are driven or stray upon another’s land and cause thjury,~ 


Force is also implied in every false imprisonment, and Trespass will lie therefor, though there may have been no actual vio-

In order to maintain trespass for an injury to personal property, it is not necessary that the property shall have been carried away or converted by 
the wrongdoer. Any forcible and immediate injury to it is sufficient. Fouldes v. Willoughby, 8 Mees. & W. 544, 151 Eng.Rep. 1170

If a person’s cattle stray upon another’s land,, and cause Injury, trespass lies, and ordinarily it is the only proper form of action; though, as we 
shall see, If they got out because of their owner’s neglect to repair a fence which he was under a duty to repair, the injured party may 
treat thIs neglect as his cause of action, and bring an action on the case for the consequential Injury. Or, he may, instead of suing in 
case, treat the trespass as his cause of action, and maintain trespass. See the following cases: English: Star v. Rookesby, 1 Salk. 335, 91 
Eng. Rep. 295 (1711); Mason v. ‘Keeling, 12 Mod. 335, 88 Eng.Rep. 1361 (1699); Iowa: Erbes v. Wehmeyer, 61) Iowa 85, 28 NW. 447

knee, nor even a touching of the person imprisoned.” 


If a man’s wife, daughter or servant is assaulted, beaten or imprisoned, there is a forcible injury to the man’s 


relative rights, for which he may maintain Trespass.’° Where 4 wife, daughter, or servant is enticed away, or seduced 
or debauched, even with her or his consent, the law implies force, and the husband, father, or master may maintain 
Trespass against the wrongdoer.” 


Generally, a mere nonfeasance cannot support an action of Trespass, for in the absence of an act there can be no 
force”? Trespass, therefore, will not lie for the mere detention of goods, where there has been no unlawful taking; - 
nor for neglect to repair the bank of a stream, whereby another’s land was overflowed; -nor for neglect to repair

tial. For consequential injuries, even though there may have been force, the remedy is by Action on the Case, and 
not Trespass’s 


If a person, in the act of throwing a log into the highway hits and injures a passerby, the injury is immediate upon 
the wrongful act, and Trespass will lie; but, If after a log has been wrongfully thrown into the highway, a passer-by f 
ails over it, Trespass will not ~ So if a steam roller were driven over a person this would be a clear Trespass, but if it 
were negligently left in the highway and a collision with a team or automobile resulted in the darkness, this would be 
a consequential injury. 


To constitute an immediate injury committed with force, it is not necessary that 
the wrongdoer shall have intended to apply the force in the manner in which it caused the injury. If a man puts in 
motion a force, the natural and probable tendency of which is to cause an injury, he is regarded in law as having 
forcible and directly caused that injury.® //’, for instance, a person lays rubbish so near another’s wall that, as a 
natural consequence, some of it rolls against the wall, the injury is forcible and immediate, and the remedy is in 
Trespass.*’ And where the defendant had ascended iii a balloon, which descended a short distance from the place of 
ascent into the plaintiff s garden, and the defendant, being entangled and in a

perilous position, called for help, and a crowd of people broke through the fences into the garden and trampled down 
the vegetables, it was held that, though ascending in a balloon was not an unlawful act, yet, as the defendant’s 
descent, under the circumstances, would ordinarily and naturally draw the crowd into the garden, either from a 
desire to assist him, or to gratify a curiosity which he had excited, he was answerable in Trespass for all the damage 
done to the garden.~ And where a person makes an excavation so near his neighbor’s land, that the land, from its 
own weight and of necessity, falls, Trespass will lie. And where a person negligently drives off another’s animal 
with his own, without endeavoring to ascertain the number of animals he is driving, Trespass is a proper remedy 
against him. 


So, where a person through negligent and careless driving, though not willfully, causes his vehicle to forcibly 
strike another vehicle or a person, the person injured need not bring an Action on the Case, though by the weight of 
authority, such an action is also maintainable, but may sue in Trespass.*°

ACTION OF TRESPASS 


167 
The same is true where a collision between vessels is caused by carelessness or unskillfulness in navigation.” And, 
generally by the weight of authority, where there is an immediate and forcible injury to person or property, 
attributable to the negligence of another, the party injured may at his election treat the negligence of the wrongdoer 
as the cause of action and Declare in Case or consider the act itself as the injury and Declare in Trespass.” Some of 
the Courts, however, hold that where the injury from a negligent act is both forcible and immediate, Case will 
not lie, and that Trespass is the only remedy.~ 


So, if a wild or vicious beast, or other dangerous thing, is turned loose or put in motion, and mischief immediately 
ensues to the person or property of another, the injury is regarded as immediate and as committed with force, and 
Trespass is the proper remedy.””

V. Shepherd, decided in 1773.90 A lighted squib or bomb had been tossed by the defendant into a market house. A 
bystander, in order to avert the threatened injury from himself, took up the squib and tossed it across the market house. 
Another person near whom it fell likewise threw it in another direction, Thereupon the squib exploded and put out 
the plaintiff's eye. An Action of Trespass was brought against the defendant who first threw the bomb, and the 
action was sustained. Sir William Blackstone, who happened to be a Member of the Court, dissented, being of the 
opinion that Case only would lie, as the harm was not the immediate and direct result of the defendant’s act. In this 
famous case there was no question of liability, but merely of the historical distinction between Forms of Action.

becoming dizzy, had involuntarily passed rapidly in the direction of a third person and came violently in contact 
with him, whereupon the latter pushed him away, and he came in contact with a hook, and was injured. It was held 
that Trespass was the proper remedy.°’

horse of another and cause it to run away, and such a consequence results, he is liable in Trespass for the injury. It is

TI a man starts a fire on his own land negligently, which spreads, and, as an immediate consequence, the 
property of another is destroyed by it, Trespass is a proper remedy for the injury.~ So if a dog is set on 
plaintiff's horses, one of which, while being pursued, is injured or killed, this is the direct result of 
defendant’s act, and Trespass is the proper form.ea 


If a person pours water directly upon another’s person or land, it is clear that the injury is immediate, and 
that Trespass is the remedy. But if a person stops a water course on his own land, whereby it is prevented 
from flowing as usual, or if he place a spout on his own building, and in consequence thereof the water 
after-wards runs therefrom upon another’s land or house or person, the injury is consequential, and Tres-

injuries under Color of Legal Proceedings 

NICE questions have arisen as to whether Trespass will lie for injuries done to the person or property 
under Color of Legal Process or Proceedings, as in case of wrongful prosecution of a criminal charge, 
wrongful arrest, or wrongful attachment of goods. 


Generally no action at all will lie for an act done under the Judgment or Order of a

Trespass ab Initio 

A PERSON may lawfully obtain possession of property under the process of a Court, or authority of a 
statute, or otherwise under authority of law, yet if he abuses his authority by dealing with the property in an 
unauthorized manner, he may become a Trespasser ab initio. ~ 


“When an entry, authority, or license is given to any one by the law, and he doth abuse it, he shall be a 
Trespasser ab iniUo; but where an entry, authority, or license is given by the party, and he abuses it, then he must be 
punished for his abuse, but shall not be a Trespasser ab initio.” 


An officer who enters a house by authority of law, and attaches goods therein, becomes a Trespasser ab initia by 
placing there an unfit person as keeper of the goods, against the remonstrance of the owner of the house.” And the same 
is true where an officer has made a lawful levy on goods, but sells without giving the notice required by law.

DECLARATION IN TRESPASS—ESSENTLAL 
ALLEGATIONS: (4) THE DAMAGES 


82. The Declaration must also Allege the Damages which are the legal and natural consequences of the injury. 
!Fhe form of statement must be according to their nature, as General or Special. 


AS the main object of the Action of Trespass is the recovery of damages, the Declaration should contain an 
Allegation of the Damage sustained, and the amount must be Jaid high enough to cover the actual demand. While the 
Trespass may, in many instances, be a mere technical infringement of another’s right, it always gives the right to recov- 
er at least Nominal Damages, but in order to recover Substantial Damages, they must be pleaded. They will be 
Generally or Particularly stated, according as they are General or Special. “General Damages are such as the law 
presumes to have accrued from the wrong complained of. Special Damages are such as the party actually sustained, 
and are not implied by law. 1 Chitty on Pleadings, 385. Such Damages as may be presumed necessarily to result 
from the breach of contract, need not be stated in the .Declaratlon. The Jaw always presumes some damages to result 
from a breach of contract, and therefore Special Damages need not be alleged. But where the plaintiff expects to 
recover Special Damages, he must state them Specially and Circumstantially in order to apprise the defendant of the 
facts intended to be proven, or he will not be permitted to give evidence of such Damages on the Trial.

1 Chitty, 332. The general rule is, that it is sufficient to assign the Breach in the words of the contract. Id. 326. An 
omission to set forth any Special Damage may deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of testimony, to which he would 
otherwise have been entitled; but it is not a good ground in Arrest of Judgment, except in cases where the special in- 
jury is the gist of action; as in Action of Slander for words not in themselves actionable. In such cases, unless the 


Special Damage is set forth, there appears no cause of action on the face of the Declaration.” M’Daniel., Admr. V. 
Terrdll, 1 Nott & McC. (S.C.) 343 (1818). 


STATUS UNDER MODERN COnES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 
83. Although the Codes provided for the abolition of the distinctions between the various Common Law Actions, with 
respect to Trespass, and Case, it has generally been held that such provision merely abolished the Formal differences 
between the actions, with the Substantive differences remaining. 


AS previously observed, one effect of the New York Code of Procedure in 1848 was ostensibly to abolish the 
Common Law Forms of Action, and the distinctions between the same, But the reform was not as sweeping as the 
language indicated. There was to be but one form of civil action in the Courts of Common Law, which was to be 
called an “Action at Law.” In plain English, the various statutes of this character, in the various states adopting the 
New York Code, provided for a single, formless form of action, in the nature of a Special Action on the Case. But in 
Goulet v. Asseler,® Selden J. flatly declared that the more formal differences between such actions had been abol- 


ished, but that the substantive differences remained as at Common Law. It was, he said, impossible to make an 
action for a direct aggression upon the plaintiffs rights by talc- 
8.22 N.Y. 225 (1860).

ing and disposing of his property—for which a remedy at Common Law was Trespass de bonis asportatis—the 
same thing as an action to recover for the consequential injury resulting from an improper interference with the 
property of another, such as an injury to a reversionary interest—and for which the remedy at Common Law was 
Trespass on the Case.° 


In the period of Reform in the Non-Code States—between 1848 and 1938—several States, like Illinois and 
Maine, enacted statutes which merely provided for the abolition of the distinctions between the Actions of Trespass 


Page 185 of 735 


and Trespass on the Case. In discussing the effect of such statutes, in St. Louis, Vandolia and Terre Haute It. It. 
Co. v. The Town of Summit)’° Baker 3, stated: ““The statute does away with the technical distinction between the 
two Forms of Action, but does not affect the substantial rights and liabilities of parties, so as to operate to give any 
other remedy for acts done than before existed.’ We understand the statute to accomplish these objects and these 
only; to abolish the technical distinction between the Two Forms of Action so that you may join Counts in Trespass

distinction between the Actions of Trespass and Trespass on the Case, the Issue was whether the plaintiff, whose interest was only that of a 
remainder-man, could maintain Trespass. In holding that the plaintiff cook? not maintab, the Action in the Form of Trespass and could not be 
allowed to Amend so as to change the Form of Action, Foster J., declared: “The Amendment changing the Declaration to Case ought not to be 
allowed. True, the Statute has abolished the 11s-tinetion between [the] Actions of Trespass and Trespass on the Case, But this relates to the 
distinetlan in Form only. In cases where the distinction Is really of Substance, rather than of Form, the Statute is inapplicable?’

Case, and may call your Action Trespass or Case—it is wholly immaterial which—and may sue out your Writ in 
either Form of Action, and may then Count in either Trespass Or Case, or both, at your option. But your Count, if in 
Case, must contain the elements df a good Count in Case, or if in Trespass, must contain the elements of a Count in 
Trespass. The change goes only to the matter of the Form of Action, and does not change Substantial Rights and 
Liabilities. Nor do we understand that this statute repeals that old and more than well settled principle, that in all 
Actions the Proofs must correspond with the Allegations. Where a Declaration is filed showing a good cause of 
action in either Trespass or Case, it is wholly immaterial whether you call your action Trespass or Case, but such 
facts must be alleged as show a Legal Cause of Action in the one Form or the other, and the facts that are alleged in 
the pleading must be supported by the proofs. If the Declaration is in Trespass guare clau.sum fregit, then there 
must be a possession in order to support it— either actual, or in case the premises are vacant and unoccupied, a 
constructive possession that follows Ownership and Title.” 


ILLINOIS REV. ST. c. 110, $ 22, 36 (1874), provided: “The distinctions between the Actions of ‘Trespass’ and 
“Trespass on the Case’ are hereby abolished; and in all cases where Trespass or Trespass on the Case has been 
heretofore the appropriate Form of Action, either of said Forms may be used, as the party bringing the action may 
elect.” 


The position of Trespass under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court is strikingly illustrated by Avery 
v. Spicer,” in which the plaintiff, in an action for cutting trees, alleged ownership and possession of the land, an 


unlawful entry by the defendants, and acts done thereon to its direct injury by 
11.90 Conn. 576, 98 A. 135 (1916).

force. One defendant justified his acts under authority of Spicer, both defendants claiming that Spicer owned in fee 
simple the land upon which the cutting was done and was in possession thereof. The Replication denied these 
allegations. 


At the Trial, it appeared that the dispute grew out of a disagreement as to the location of the boundary line 
between the properties of the contending parties. The plaintiff claimed, as evidenced by title deeds, up to a point 
beyond which the cutting took place, whereas the defendant Spicer contended that his ownership included the 
property on which the cutting took place. 


The Court instructed the Jury that the plaintiff, in order to be entitled to a Verdict, must prove that he was in 
actual or constructive possession of the land; that it was not necessary that the plaintiff show actual possession, but 
that sufficient proof of possession would be produced by proof of Title and the absence of actual and exclusive 
possession in another. 


On an Appeal, the validity of this Charge 
to the Jury was the principal issue. In holding for the defendants and that there was no error, Chief Justice Prentice 


Page 186 of 735 


observed: 

“Passing by Trespass with its requirement of possession as a prerequisite of recovery, there was in the Common- 
Law System a Form of Action providing for the redress of an injury suffered by one having an interest in property, 
but not having the possession. 

By an Action of Trespass on the Case one 

whose reversionary interest had been invaded by a wrongdoer might have redress. But the Action could not be 
resorted to by one whose interest, instead of being reversion- 

ary, was such as the right of possession attached to it. A fee owner, for example, might not avail himself of it to 
redress a wrong done to his property by direct force, express or implied, His interest is possessory and not 
reversionary, as is that of a landlord, remainderman, and the like. 

Two pertinent facts of present interest and importance thus appear. The first is that a person whose interest was not 
reversionary was not permitted to recover f or injury to property unless he could show possession, actual or 
constructive. The second is but its corollary, to wit, that a title owner disseised could not sue his disseisor, for the 
latter’s acts of wrongdoing to the property as long as the disseisin continued. The disseisee in such case must either 
first regain possession by legal action or otherwise, and then bring his Action of Trespass for the injury to the 
property, or recover for those injuries as an incident of his action to regain possession. He could not sue the disseisor 
for the tort independently until he had come into possession. ... The substitution of our Practice Act for the 
Common-Law System of Pleading has not changed the situation save as it has abolished certain formal distinctions 
and employed a new nomenclature. The same facts will entitle one to the same redress as before, and to no other 
redress.” 12 


It thus appears that although there is a change, in name, substantively the requirements for bringing an Action 
under Modern Codes, Practice Acts or Rules of Court, which would be the equivalent of the Action of Trespass, 


under the Common Law, are still the same.

Trespass and Trespass on the Case are supplementary to each other; and it may be said that, in 


general, Case lies where no other theory or Form of Action is available, though it is sometimes 
concurrent with other forms. The Statute of Westminster 11 (1285) authorized the Clerks in Chancery to issue New 
Writs in cases similar to, but not identical with, cases in which Writs had been previously issued. Various theories have 
been advanced as to the effect of this Statute upon the development of the action of Trespass on the Case. 


Trespass and Case as the Source of Our Tort 
Law 


e AT Common Law civil injuries were divided into two kinds, the one without force or violence, such as deceit, libel 
and slander, or the detention of goods; the other, coupled with force and violence, such as assault and battery or 
false imprisonment. This distinction between private wrongs resulting from forcible injuries and those without force 
arose out of the Forms of Action or Remedies which were available. The two great Remedies which thus divided the

joint product of these two Actions. 


From the nucleus of violent wrongs, originally remediable alone by the Action of Trespass, remedies were 
extended to cover non-violent injuries under the great residuary Action of Trespass on the Case, popularly referred 
to merely as “Case.” The Action was not based ON any distinct theory of wrong except the supplementary and exclu- 
sory one, covering all non-violent injuries, that is, those not falling within the theory of trespass. Case proceeded 
either by analogy to Trespass, where there was an indirect application of force, or on the general Common-Law 
principle of affording a remedy for every wrong, even though without violence, direct or indirect. There was and 
there is still no strict limit to this action and it is the vehicle which the Judges in England and America have used

for “maliciously enticing away the plaintiff's husband, and thereby alienating from her his affections.” In sustaining the wife’s action, 
Minturn, 3., declared: “That the Common-Law Courts failed to find a remedy is, under the decisions, rather a recognition of the right, than the 
denial of Its existence. Per it may be said that the history of Common-Law Procedure is largely the history of Substantive Rights, remediless

redress for such wrongs as deceit, detention of goods, libel and slander, malicious prosecution, negligent injuries 
and nuisance.° 


Development of Trespass on the Case 

IT should be observed that in the beginning the only remedy for Torts was the Action of Trespass, and that in order 
to maintain it, actual or implied violence must be shown. It was formerly thought, that up until the Enactment of the 
Statute of Westminster H in 1285, there was no Form of Action or Original Writ which could be invoked to recover 
Damages for other or nonviolent injuries; that under this Statute the Action of Trespass on the Case arose under 
which any aggrieved party could sue for damages for any wrong to which Trespass would not apply; that the Action 
originated in the power given by the Statute to the Clerks in Chancery to frame New Writs in consimili casu— that 
is, in cases similar to, but not identical with, cases in which Writs had been previously issued. 


This view of the Action of Trespass on the Case, as being the product of the Statute of Westminster IT (1285), has 
been placed in grave doubt by the latest research on the subject. Fifoot flatly declares that “The Actions on the Case 
derived, not from the statutory powers of Chancery Clerks, but from the Fiat of Judges.” ~ And those authorities 
who agree with Fifoot, point out that when Case underwent its initial development 


the demand for a remedy developed the Action of Trespass on the Case as a General Specific in consimlU casu under the provisions of the 
Statute of Westmin ster II.” 


The learned judge simply was not conversant with the latest research in the field concerning the alleged relationship of the Statute and the Action 
of Trespass on the Case. 


3’ See 3 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, c. xvIII, The Action of Trespass on the Case, 245 (Northport 1906). 


4 Fifoot, History and Sources of the Common Law, c. IV, The Development of the Actions on the Case, 74 (London 1949). 

in the last third of the Fourteenth Century, it was founded, not upon Writs issued by the Clerks in Chancery, but 
upon Writs issued by the Judges under the broad authority of the Common Law, using the Action of Tres pass as 
the stock for grafting, as illustrated in The Miller’s Case ~ and The Innkeeper’s Case.” 

However this may be, the New Writs invented by the Judges to cover the cases were supposed to bear an analogy 
to Trespass and hence received the appellation of Trespass on the Case (bi-evi.a de ti-ansgressione super casuin), 
as being grounded upon the particular circumstances of the case requiring a remedy, and in order to distinguish them 
from the older and parent Action of Trespass; and likewise, for further differentiation, the injuries themselves, which 
were the subject of such Writs, were not called “Trespasses,” but “Torts,” “Wrongs,” or “Grievances.” 


The Writs of Trespass on the Case, though invented pro re nata, in various forms, according to the nature of the 
different wrongs which called them forth, began, nevertheless, to be viewed as constituting collectively a New 
Individual Form of Action. Accordingly, this new genus took its place, under the name of “Trespass on the Case,” 
alongside of the more ancient actions of Debt, Covenant, Trespass and the like. 


Page 189 of 735 


In view of the Origin and Nature of this Action, it is important to note that it is comprised of several different 
species, two of which, however, are of more frequent use and of greater significance than any other, to wit, the Action 
of Trover and the Action of Assumpsit, both of which developed out of Case, and were originally known as Tres- 
pass on the Case in Assumpsit and Trespass on the Case in Trover, but now referred to respectively simply as 
“Assumpsit” and

“Trover.” Other Forms of the Action of Trespass on the Case are generally known and designated as “Case” or as 
an “Action on the Case.” 


CASE DISTINGUISHED FROM TRESPASS 


85. The distinctions between wrongs which 
are included under Trespass and those under Case relate: 
(I) To the element of Force, Express or Implied, 
(ID) Whether the injury is immediate or consequential on defendant’s act, 
(IIL) ‘Whether the liability is for Trespasses Of defendant’s agents, 
(TV) Whether possession is interfered with. 


ALTHOUGH Case was complementary to Trespass, the two actions were to a certain extent mutually exclusive,’ and in 
theory distinctly differentiated. Where the factual situation essential to constitute a trespass exists, as, for example, 
where the act was direct and wilful, the Action must be in Trespass. If, however, there was something else in the 
factual situation, such as negligence, the plaintiff might have an option as to Case or Trespass. And, of course, 
where any one of the elements required to constitute a trespass is wanting, the Remedy is in Case, assuming 
the facts make out a Torts 


Distinction Between Trespass and Case—In General 

AS we have already seen, where a Tort or Civil Wrong is committed with force, actual or implied, and the 
matter affected is tangible, as where the person or corporeal property of another is affected, and the injury is 
immediate, and not merely consequential, and, in the case of injury to property, the property was in possession of 
the person 


7. Day v. Edwards, 5 P.R. 648, 101 Eng.Rep. 361 
(1794). 


complaining, the proper remedy to recover damages for the injury is the Aclion of Trespass.° If, on the other 
hand, a Tort is committed without force, actual or implied, or if, though the Act was committed with 
force, the matter affected was not tangible, or the injury was not immediate, but consequential, or, in the 
case of injury to property, the plaintiff's interest in the property was only in reversion, Trespass will not 
lie, and the proper remedy is Action on the Case.” 


The Element of Force 

UNLESS the case falls within one of the exceptions which we have already stated, and which will 
presently be explained more at length, an Action on the Case will not lie for an injury committed with 
force, but the party injured must sue in Trespass. Trespass is excluded, however, if the harm resulted 
indirectly from the act of the defendant, or the injury was not to the possession of the plaintiff. 

Force is either actual or implied. Assault and Battery, tearing down a fence, or breaking into a house 
are examples of actual force, and there is no difficulty in determining that Trespass, and not Case, is 
usually the only remedy. 

In many cases where there is no actual force, the Law will imply force, and the ef

fect will be the same as if there had been actual force, so far as regards the Form of Action. Force, as we have seen, 
is implied in every Trespass Quare Clausum Fregit. If a man, without right, goes upon another’s land, however 
quietly and peaceable, the Law will imply force, and Trespass is the remedy, not Case; and the same is true where a 
man’s cattle stray upon another’s land. Force is also implied in every false imprisonment, and the proper remedy is 
Trespass, and not Case. And where a wife, daughter, or servant is debauched, or enticed away, the Law implies 
force, notwithstanding their consent, and the husband, parent, or master may declare in Trespass.”! And where a fire 
is started, and, as an immediate consequence, another’s property is destroyed, there is constructive force ..-- 


Generally, as we have seen, a mere nonfeasance cannot be regarded as forcible; for where there has been no act 
there can be no force. There is no force, for instance, in a mere detention of goods without an unlawful taking; or in 
neglect to repair the bank of a stream, whereby another’s land is overflowed; ‘~ or in neglect to repair a fence 
whereby another’s animal escapes on to the land of the person so negligent or elsewhere, and is injured; - and in 
these instances Case, and not Trespass, must be the remedy.

Massachusetts: 
The Injury as Immediate or Consequential 

Even though an injury may have been committed by force, Case will lie, if it was not immediate, but 
consequential; for, to sustain Trespass, as we have seen, the injury must have been imnwdiate. An injury is 
considered as immediate when the act complained of, itself, and not merely a consequence of that act, occasioned it. 
But where the damage or injury ensued, not directly from the act complained of, it is consequential or mediate, and 
cannot amount to a trespass.” 


To take an illustration already used, if a person in the act of throwing a log into the highway hits and injures a 
passer-by, the injury is immediate, and trespass is the proper remedy; but if, after a log has been thrown into the 
highway, some one in passing, falls over it, and is injured, the injury is consequential, and the Action must be in 
Case.” 


If a person forcibly takes another’s goods, the Action must generally be Trespass. An Action on the Case, 
however, will also lie at the suit of a seller of goods against a person who, after the sale and before delivery, fordbly 
and wrongfully takes the goods, and so

puts it out of the seller’s power to perform his contract, so that the buyer avoids it; for the injury by the loss of the 
sale is consequential. Trespass would lie for the forcible and wrongful taking; Case will also lie for the 
consequential injury, so that here the two actions are concurrent remedies.”

If a blow be given to the person or property of another, the Action must be Trespass, and not Case.” And if a

though in such a case the injury is immediate upon the violence.” Trespass would also lie in such a

of Trespass. The explanation of the result probably lies in the fact that the Court was willing to stretch a point in order to avoid a reversal 
on this barren technicality.

19. In Bicker v. Freeman, 50 N.H. 420 (1870), it appeared that the defendant had seized the plaintiff by the arm and swung him violently around, 
and let hini go, and, that the plaintiff, having become dizzy, involuntarily passed rapidly In the direction of a third person, and came 
violently in contact with him, whereupon the latter pushed him away, and he caine in contact with a hook and was injured. It was held that 
Trespass, not Case, was the Remedy. See, also, Lowery v. Manhattan R. Co., 99 N.Y. 158, 1 N.E. 608 (1885); Tuttle v. Atlantic City B. Co.,

injury is merely attributable to negligence or want of skill, and not to willfulness, the party injured may, at his 
election, sue in Case or Trespass.” In these cases the negligence or unskillful-ness of the defendant is treated as the 
Cause of Action when Case is brought, while in Trespass the act itself is the Cause of Action. By the weight of 
authority, the rule is not confined to these particular cases, but is general, that where there is an immediate injury to 
person or property attributable to negligence, the party injured has an election either to treat the negligence of the 
wrongdoer as the Cause of Action, and to declare in Case, or to consider the act itself as the injury, and to declare 
in Trespass.”

TRESPASS ON THE CASE 

If a person pours water directly upon another’s person or land, the injury is immediate and trespass is the proper 
remedy.” But if a person stops a water course on his own land, whereby it is prevented from flowing as usual, or if 
he place a spout on his own building, and in consequence thereof the water afterwards runs therefrom upon anoth- 
er’s land or house or person, the injury is consequential, and Case is the proper action.” Case also lies where 
excavations are made by a person on his own land in such a way as tocause the soil of an adjoining proprietor to 
fall.” And it lies for injury to person or property communicated by infection.” 


If a person entices away, or seduces, or debauches another’s wife, daughter, or servant, the Law, as we have seen, 
implies force, and the husband, father or master may sue

And where a person negligently causes the burning of another’s property, as where a fire is set by sparks from a 
railroad company’s locomotive, or where a man starts a fire on his own land and it reaches and burns adjoining 
property, Case is the proper action?” 


As we have seen, if a person’s cattle stray on another’s land and cause injury, Trespass by the latter is the proper 
remedy.” If, however, the cattle got out because of the owner’s neglect of his duty to repair fences, the person may 
treat this neglect as his Cause of Action, and bring Case for the consequential injury; - or he may sue in Trespass as 
in other cases, treating the Trespass as his Cause of Action.” 


Intangible Property or Rights 

AS we have shown, in treating of Trespass, where the property or right injured is intangible, as the right to 
reputation, or health and comfort, or incorporeal real property, the injury can never be considered as committed with 
force, however malicious and however contrived, for the matter injured cannot possibly be affected immediately by 
any substance. Case, therefore, and not Trespass,

TRESPASS ON THE CASE 
is’ 

injunction and an accounting is the usual remedy. 


If the injury is to corporeal property, and is immediate, and committed with force, case will not lie merely 
because that property was the means by which an incorporeal right was enjoyed. Thus, where, by Legislative 
Authority, a dam has been erected and maintained in a navigable river in connection with a mill, and the dam is 
wrongfully cut away by another, Case will not lie on the ground that an incorporeal right has been injured. “The 
ground on which the Form of Action was endeavored to be maintained,” it was said in an Action on the Case for 
such a wrong, “was that the right to erect the dam, for an injury to which the action was brought, was a franchise, 
and incorporeal hereditament, and that for an injury to property, or right of that description, Trespass tvill not lie. 
The principle here adverted to does not apply to the case. The right to erect the dam is a franchise; it is conferred by 
the legislature, the sovereign power; it is an incorporeal right, but the dam itself is not a franchise, nor is it 
incorporeal. The right to keep a ferry, or to erect a bridge, or to navigate a particular river or lake by steam, may be a 
franchise; but the bridge itself, or the boats and machinery employed in the ferry, or the navigation of the river, 
may, notwithstanding, be the subjects of Trespass. *** So far as the incorporeal right is invaded, the redress is by 
Action on the Case. But when Visible, tangible, corporeal property is injured, if the injury is direct, immediate and 
willful, Trespass is the proper Form of Action, although that property may be connected with, or be the means by 
which an incorporeal right is enjoyed.” ~ 


ELECTION BETWEEN TRESPASS 
AND CASE 
86. When an injury results directly from a Negligent Act, the injured party has an Election of 


Remedies. The injured party may main- 
tam an Action in Trespass, relying upon the fact that the injury resulted directly from the act; or he may maintain an 


Page 195 of 735 


Action of Tres. pass on the Case relying upon the negligence as the basis for the action. 


WHILE Trespass and Case were designed to apply to different factual situations, as we have seen, there came a 
time in their development, when the effort to distinguish the two actions on the basis of proximity, broke down, and 
it was realized that a single tortious act might be at one and the same time a direct trespass and an injury resulting 
from negligence, actionable on the basis of a legal principle other than that effectuated by the Action of Trespass. 
Thus, in Dalton v. F avour,” where the plaintiff was wounded by the accidental discharge of a gun held by the 
defendant, the wrong contained all the elements of Trespass. But looked at from another viewpoint, or with a 
fuller understanding of the facts, the act may be the foundation of another tort. In such a situation the injured person 
sues in Trespass on the basis of a direct and forcible injury, or he may elect to treat the tort as the result of 
negligence in maneuvering the gun, and hence declare in Case.” When, therefore, in Leame v. Bray,” there was a 
collision, which was caused by negligence which combined facts of force, direct injury, as well as infringement of 
possession there was clearly a Trespass. But the same factual situation might be treated as the consequences of an 
anterior tort, to wit, the guilty party’s negligent driving, which might be regarded as a wrong of another species for 
which the remedy might be Case and not Trespass. It thus appears that the injured party has a choice of remedies, as 
was held in Williams

v. Holland,” according to the view he takes of the wrongdoer’s conduct; he may sue in Trespass for the forcible 
wrong, or make the negligence of the defendant the ground of his action and declare in Case. Other acts 
trespassatory in their character may be injurious because of their indirect results, as in the case of the seduction of a 
man’s wife, or daughter, in which instance Case would be the proper remedy, the plaintiff making the consequences 
of the act—the loss of services 

—the gist of his Complaint.” But clearly, the plaintiff-husband may elect to treat the direct injury to his wife or 
daughter as the basis of the action, in which case Trespass is the proper remedy.” 


FORM OF THE DECLARATION IN 
TRESPASS ON TUE CASE 


87. As the action of Trespass on the Case was the Great Residuary Remedy of the Common Law, the forms in which it has

which it has afforded a remedy.

whereas the defendant before, and at the time of the commencement of this suit, and of the injury and damage 
occurring, as hereinafter mentioned, was the possessor and occupier of a certain messuage, vault, cellar, and 
premises, with appurtenances, situated in the town of Liverpool, in the County of Lancaster, and near to a certain 
common and public footway there, and in which vault and cellar there was a certain hole or aperture opening into 
the said public footway. Yet the defendant, well knowing the premises, whilst he was so the possessor and occupier 
of the said messuage, vault, cellar, and premises, with the appurtenances, and whilst there was such hole as 
aforesaid, heretofore, to wit, on the first day of May, in the year of our Lord 1845, wrongfully and unjustly, and 
contrary to his duty in that behalf, permitted the said hole to be, and continue, and the same was then so badly, 
insufficiently, and defectively covered, that, by means of the premises, and for want of a proper and sufficient 
covering to the said hole, the plaintiff, who was then lawfully passing in and along the said footway, then slipped 
and fell into the said hole, and thereby the left leg of the plaintiff was then fractured and broken, and greatly 
damaged; and the plaintiff became and was sick, sore, lame, and disordered, and so remained and continued for a 
long time, to wit, thence hitherto, during all which time the plaintiff thereby suffered and underwent great pain, and 
was prevented from attending to and transacting his lawful affairs and business, by him during that time to be 
performed and transacted; and was also, by means of the premises, forced and obliged to pay, lay out, and expend,

DECLARATION IN TRESPASS ON THE CASE 
—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (1) INGENERAL 
88. The Essential Allegations in Actions 

of Trespass on the Case are: 


(D The plaintiff's Right, Title or Possession; 
(ID The Facts showing the existence of a Legal Duty on the part of the defendant; 


(I) A Wrongful Act by the defendant in Breach of his Duty; 


(IV) Damages proximately caused by the Wrongful Act. 
DECLARATION IN TRESPASS ON THE 
CASE—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (2) 
THE PLAINTIFF’S RIGHT, TITLE, INTEREST OR POSSESSION 


89. In the case of injury to chattels, plaintiff’s right or interest in them is usually suff iciently described by an averment 
that they are his goods and chattels, or that he was lawfully possessed of them as his own property. 


IN actions for injury to property, the plaintiff's right or interest in the thing affected must be clearly stated. In the 
case of injury to chattels, the plaintiff's right or interest in them will be ordinarily sufficiently described by an 
averment that they are his goods and chattels, or that he was lawfully possessed of them as his own property; but 
‘lif the plaintiff sues as a reversioner, he must either state an injury of such a permanent nature, as to be necessarily 
injurious to his reversion; or if the wrongful acts complained of are not of such a nature as necessarily to result in an 


Page 197 of 735 


injury to the reversionary estate, but only of an equivocal character, the plaintiff must aver that they were done to the 
damage, or prejudice of his reversion; and in the latter case, the want of such an averment, will 
be fatal on demurrer; or good cause for arresting the judgment.” s 


Where the injury is to intangible personal rights such as reputation or incorporeal property rights, such as an easement 
and reversion, Case and not Trespass is the proper remedy. 


Revcrsio’nary Right of Bailor 

UNDER the Common-Law Forms of Action, a bailor could not ordinarily bring an Action of Trespass, Trover or 
Detinue, these actions being founded upon a violation of possession or upon an immediate right of possession.” 
Where any permanent injury is done to a chattel, the bailor may maintain an Action on the Case against a third party 
for an injury to his reversionary interest.” The bailor also has concurrent possessory remedies with the bailee, if the 
bailment is revocable by him at his pleasure as in the case of a gratuitous loan of a chaise.”

it arises from the relation of passenger and carrier or master and servant, or where the defendant was in control of 
some dangerous machinery or a vicious animal. 


THE Declaration in Trespass on the Case must not only allege a right or interest in the plaintiff but it must also 
set forth a duty existing on the part of the defendant, and a violation of that duty. If, however, the right which is 
violated is that of personal security, this need not be stated.” It is usually necessary to state somewhat fully the facts 
and circumstances showing the existence of a duty toward the plaintiff on the part of the defendant, the neglect or 
breach of which would be an injury to the plaintiff.” 


Thus, in an action for negligent injury, it must appear that the plaintiff was in a situation where the defendant 
owed him a duty to exercise due care for his safety, as that the defendant was in control of machinery or other 
agency causing danger to the plaintiff, for which the defendant was responsible. A bare allegation that the defendant 
owed a legal duty to the plaintiff is a mere conclusion of law and hence worthless; the facts creating the duty must 
be alleged, as that the relation of carrier and passenger existed.” The existence of the defendant’s duty

In Gillman v. Chicago Rys. Co., 268 Ill. 305, 109 N.E. 181 (1915), it was held that in an Action of Tort in a fourth class case in the Municipal 
Court of Chicago the statement of claim must show a Cause of Action based on a Breach of Legal Duty by the defendant, such, for example, 
as facts showing the relation of carrier and passenger, a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and neglect of that duty by the defendant 
or its servants in the scope of their employment, and damage to the plaintiff as the result of that neglect. The Court emphasizes the function of 
the Statement of Claim, which is the substitute for a Declaration, as the basis of a Judgmeat, and the insufilcieney of the statement of clainr 


may be availed of on a Writ of Error even in the’ absence of a Demurrer. 


50- A Declaration by an employee against a corporation, his employer, for injury by a grindstone bursting should allege; (1) the relation, that 
plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant and was its servant, and was subject to its orders and directions in his work; (2) the duty of the 
defendant to furnish safe appliances and place to work; (3) the negligent acts of defendant hs permitting the rindstone to he and remain in a 
dangerous condition, showing how it was defective and why dangerous, and that defendant knew or ought to have known of the defects; 
(4) the causal connection between the negligence and the injury; (5) the due care of the plaintiff (in some Jurisdictions) and the fact that 
plaintiff did not know of the danger and was not chargeable with knowledge of It; (6) the damages. What Allegations show a Breach of the

of responsibility, such as intent or negligence or malice or fraud, must be alleged. 


IN Declarations in Trespass, the injury is stated without any averment of the defendant’s motive or intent or of the 
circumstances under which it was committed. In general, in actions on the case, it is necessary to state, not only the 
wrongful act complained of, but also the wrongful intent, fraud, or negligence with which it was done and the cir- 
cumstances showing that it was wrongful. In some actions the scienter (knowledge) must be alleged and proved, as 
of the vicious propensity of the dog in an action for keeping a dog accustomed to bite people or sheep. But in an 
action for debauching a wife or servant it is not necessary to allege or prove that the defendant knew that the female 
was the wife or servant of the plaintiff. 


In actions for negligence there is some conflict whether a general charge of negligence, as that defendant so 
negligently and carelessly operated a car that plaintiff was thrown from the car and injured, is sufficient, or 


whether the facts and circumstances 
-showing negligence must be stated specifically.°° When it is said that it is sufficient to

That a General Allegation may be permitted, see:

where the plaintiff was working with tile knowledge of the defendant. Illinois Cent. Ry. Co. v. Aland, 192 Iii. 


plead negligence generally, it is usually meant that the pleader, having set out the specific facts showing a duty of 
care and acts causing injury, may state generally that such acts were negligently done. A mere general averment of 
negligence is insufficient.” 


In the case of a passenger injured in a 


street car collision, it will be sufficient for the declaration to show that the plaintiff was a passenger upon 
defendant’s car, that defendant was a common carrier, and that defendant failed to perform its duty to carry safely, 
by permitting the car to collide with another of defendant’s cars. It will not be necessary to plead the facts showing 
the cause of the collision, as the facts alleged bring the case within the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur,” and an 
allegation of negligence is unnecessary.°

DECLARATION IN TRESPASS ON TIIE CASE—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (5) THE DAMAGES 


92. It must appear that the Wrongful Act of the defendant was the legal cause of the injury to the plaintiff’s right. 


THE Declaration must state the damages resulting as the legal and natural consequences of the injury done. 
These may be general or special, and special damages should be alleged specifically. In many torts falling 
within the scope of the action on the case, damage is the gist of the action, and must be alleged in order to show a 
cause of action.

ant, which follow as the legal and natural consequences of such injury, are recoverable, nd should be laid in a 
sum sufficiently high t~i cover all the plaintiff expects to prove, as his recovery will be limited by the amount 
stated. As in all other actions the damages may be either general or special and, if special or peculiar to the case, 
they must be alleged specifically.”” Recovery will be confined to the injuries alleged by the declaration to have 
resulted from the particular negligence charged. In Case, unlike Trespass, damage is usually an essential element of 
liability. 


PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS OF CASE AS THE GREAT RESIDUARY COMMON-LAW 
REMEDY FOR VARIOUS WRONGS 


93. Case lies for certain wrongs of negligence and misfeasance, which may be committed in the course 
of performance of a contract, and also for the nonperformance of certain obligations prescribed by 


law, such as those incident to hailments and public callings; also neglect of official duty, and for certain statutory 
liabilities.

remedy because of the lack of an appropriate Writ or precedent in the Register of Writs, until the persistence of 
a demand for remedy developed the Action of Trespass on the Case to cover all cases similar to, but not quite 
identical with Trespass.” In the beginning the new action was merely supplementary to the old. But through the 
continual and constantly expanding application of Case, the first instance of which appeared in 1369,69 as a 
remedy for a wide variety of human wrongs, not otherwise remediable, most of our modern law, contract, quasi- 
contract, property, and tort, has been evolved, and by reason thereof, the Common Law has been able to largely 
make good its proud boast, first uttered as early as and by Bracton, that where there is a wrong there is a 
remedy. It is for this reason that the Action on the Case is fitquently referred to as the Great Residuary Remedy 
of the Common Law. 


Torts in Connection with Contract 

MERE breach of Contract, without more, will not sustain an Action on the Case, but the remedy is Assumpsit, 
Covenant, or Debt.” But often one of the parties to a contract may commit a tort in the execution of it, or in its 
nonperformance, and case may lie for the injury. Thus, it lies against attorneys or other agents for neglect or other 
breach of duty, or misfeasance in the conduct of a cause, or other business,” though it is

more usual to declare in Assumpsit. Assumpsit is the usual remedy for neglect or breach of duty against bailees, as 
against carriers, wharfingers, warehousemen, and others having the use or care of personal property, whose liability is 
founded on the Common Law as well as upon Contract; but they are also liable in case for an injury resulting from 
their neglect or breach of duty in the course of their employment.” For any nonfeasance by a party in a public 
employment which he professes, an Action on the Case will lie by the party injured, as where a common carrier fails 
to perform its common law obligation to serve all who apply.”

If goods are obtained on credit through a fraudulent contract, the proper remedy is Case (or Trover), at least 
before the expiration of the credit; for if, before that time, Assumpsit is brought to recover the price, it is a 
recognition and aflirmance of the contract, and it may be successfully met by the defense that the term of credit has 
not expired.

against a tenant for permissive waste (that is, a neglect to repair), there is a conflict of opinion. It seems that it does 
not lie, and that the only remedy is on the covenants in the lease.*” 


Injury to a Lien 

IN the New York case of Yates v. Joyce,*° the plaintiff, A, alleged that he, as assignee of a Judgment from one K 
against J, which was a lien on the property of J, was about to take out Execution and seize a certain lot of land; that 
the defendant, B, well knowing the premises and intending to injure the plaintiff, and prevent him having satisfaction, 
tore down a barn on the premises worth $300, leaving the ground of less value than the plaintiff’s judgment; and 
that J, being insolvent, had no other property with which to satisfy the Judgment. The defendant Demurred, and on 
the argument contended that the plaintiff, having a mere lien only, and not being in possession could not 
maintain any action against the defendant, who is answerable only to the person in possession, and that there 
was no precedent for such an action. 


The Court, in overruling the defendant’s Demurrer, declared: “This appears to be an action of the first 
impression. The books do not furnish a precedent in its favor. It is obvious, however, from the statement of the 
plaintiffs case, in the Declaration the truth of which is admitted by the Demurrer, that he has sustained damage by 
the act of the defendant, which he alleges was done fraudulently, and with intent to injure him. It is the pride of the 
Common Law, that wherever it recognizes or creates a private

right, it also gives a remedy for the wilful violation of it. The facts stated in the Declaration being admitted by the 
Demurrer, we are to assume that the plaintiff had acquired a legal lien on the property, by means of the 
Judgment in favor of Kane, and the assignment of it to himself; and that the injury to the property was done with a 
full know!edge of the plaintiff’s rights. If, then, there is any remedy for him, it is in this Form of Action only that he 
can obtain it. Trespass will not lie; for the plaintiff was not in possession. The principle which governed the 
decision in the case of Smith v. Tonstall, (Carth. 3; 13 Vin.Abr. 553) is somewhat analogous. It was there ruled 
that an action will lie against the defendant for confessing 

a Judgment by fraud, in order to pi’event the 

plaintiff from having the benefit of a Judgment he had obtained against him. It is sound principle, that where the 
fraudulent misconduct of a party occasions an injury to the private rights of another, he shall be responsible in 
damages for the same; and such is the case presented by the pleadings in this cause.” ~ 


Injury to Reversionary interest 

TRESPASS quase clausum fregit may be maintained by the owner of land for an injury to his freehold where it 
is in the occupation of a tenant at will.’ This doctrine was not extended so as to apply to a remainder-man who was 
not entitled to possession. And it has been held that such an action will not lie by the reversioner for waste 
committed by a person acting under the authority of the tenant for life.” But the reversioner or re

mainderman is not without remedy when the injury is of a permanent character affecting the inheritance, for in such 
case an Action of Trespass on the Case would heY° The Rule of Pleading, as clearly laid down in the leading case of 
Jackson v. Pesked,” is that where the plaintiff sues as a reversioner, he must either state an injury of such a 
permanent nature as to be necessarily injurious to his reversion; or if the wrongful acts complained of are not of such 
a character as necessarily to result in an injury to the reversionary estate, but only of an equivocal nature, the 
plaintiff must allege that they were done to the damage or prejudice of his reversion; and in the latter case, the lack 
of such an allegation, will be fatal on demurrer; or good cause for arresting the judgment.” 


injury to Freehold by Tenant at Will 

AT Common Law, a landlord, in order to maintain Trespass, must have been in actual possession of the premises 
at the time the trespass occurred.”* And he had no Remedy in Waste against a tenant at will.” In this situation 
it has usually been said that the wrongful act of the tenant at will terminated the tenancy, restored the possession to 
the landlord, who could then maintain an Action of Trespass. Actually there was no direct forcible invasion of the 
landlord’s possession; in fact the tenant had possession by legal means. But in the face of an urgent demand for a 
remedy, by resort to a fiction, Trespass

was commandeered to serve, and to fill in a temporary gap in the remedial law, although its fundamental theory that 
it lay only for wrongful interference with possession, was clearly violated; the tenant at will in fact remained in 
possession after his misconduct. Thus Trespass, Case not being in existence when the problem first arose, was 
stretched beyond all semblance of its original theory. to cover what was in fact an indirect, consequential injury to 
the landlord’s interest. And the proof of this is that when Case came in, it was said in West v. Treude -- that the 
landlord might have either an Action on the Case or Trespass against a tenant at will. In time however Trespass 
ceased to be used and the accepted remedy became an Action on the Case in the Nature of Waste. 


Seduction of Another Man’s Daughter, Wife or Servant 

WHEN the demand for a remedy arose for the seduction or debauching of another’s daughter, wife or servant, the 
first remedy given by the Common Law was Trespass vi et armis, the law implying force, thus enabling the father, 
husband or servant to sue 
in that action.” Here again the injury was an indirect consequential one, and here, again, as in the tenant at will 
case, Trespass was commandeered to supply a remedy, Case not yet being available. By resort to a fiction, the courts 
treated the daughter as the servant of the master, who thus acquired a possessory interest. Seduction was an inter- 
ference with such possessory interest, resulting in damage, for which Trespass thus became a remedy, When Case 
came in, it was utilized as a remedy for what was clearly an indirect consequential injury, not an injury to the 
possession of the husband, par-

ent or master. Accordingly, in Chamberlain v. Hazlewoodj” we find the plaintiff bringing Case for the 
consequential damage. In such case he may now, at his election, treat the loss of society or services, and not the 
defendant’s act of seduction, as the injury, and, as that is merely consequential, sue in Case.°* 


The order of development is illustrated by two New York cases; in the first, Alcerley v. 

Haines, ?” decided in the year 1805, Trespass was held to be the proper remedy for the seduction of a daughter, 
whereas, in the second, Moran v. Dawes,' decided just twenty years later, in 1825, the Supreme Court of the State 
sustained Case, declaring: “It is clear, we think, both upon principle and authority, that Case, is, without exception, 
a proper remedy. (Selw. N. P. 1083, note (17) cites 2 T.R. 167, 8, per Euller, 3., and per Holt, C. J., Ld. Raym. 1032.) 
Neither the injury to the person of the child nor the property of the plaintiff are, in truth, ever taken into the account. 
They are little more than a mere fiction, adopted in order to sustain the Remedy by Trespass. The direct injury may 
be waived in all cases; and the declaration framed to meet the consequential injury, disregarding entirely every con- 
sideration except the loss of service, and the more important one of seduction and disgrace. A very usual case may 
be supposed, in which, if we are to be governed by the technical rules relating to an Action of Trespass, the father 
would be remediless for the most aggravated form of the injury, unless he has an election. The seducer is received at 
the dwelling of the father on the footing of a suitor; he thus having a license to enter the house, of which 
he avails himself to accomplish the seduction, with the consent of

the daughter. It could hardly be said that Trespass and Assault would lie for such an act, The father is then put to 
his remedy by Trespass guare domum fregit, laying the seduction, &c., by way of aggravation. The defendant does 
not become a trespasser ab initio, for license was given by the party. A person who is guilty of abusing an authority 
in fact, does not thereby become a trespasser ab initio; but it is otherwise where a license is given by the law.” 2 


Actions Against the Master for Injuries Occasioned by the Wrong of the Servant— Vicarious LiaNlity 

THE relation of master and servant was and is contractual in nature. Once the relationship was established 
obligations accrued on both sides. The master was under a duty to provide a safe place to work, to provide safe 
appliances and equipment, to warn the servant of dangerous conditions on the premises, to provide suitable and 
competent fellow servants, and to make reasonable rules to regulate the conduct of the work. On the other hand 
the servant was required to exercise reasonable care for his own safety and in the exercise of his duties within the 
scope of his employment. And it is important to observe that once the master-servant relationship is established, the 
master may be subjected to vicarious liability for the servant’s torts, although the master is free of any wrongful 
conduct.’ Such liability has to do with those acts so closely related with what the servant was employed to do, 
and which were reasonably incidental to it, as they could be viewed as methods, although of questionable 
validity, of carrying out the master’s instructions. As to what acts are authorized, depends upon the time, place and 
purpose of the act, together with its similarity to the acts authorized. And in 1834, In

TRESPASS ON THE CASE 
193 


the case of Joel v. Morrison,* Baron Parke, ruled that a master was not liable for the tortious acts of his servant 
where the servant was not in pursuit of his master’s business, but was “on a frolic of his own.” 


In general, the master is subject to liability for injuries caused by the tortious conduct of the servant where such 
conduct is within the scope of his employment; and the remedy against the master for injuries resulting from the 
wrong of his servant is in Case, even though, against the servant, it might for the same act be Trespass; s but under 
some circumstances, the master may also be liable in Trespass.° Where an injury arises from the want of care or 
negligence of the servant, the remedy against the master is in Case; but if it occurs as the necessary or natural and 
probable consequence of an act of the servant, ordered expressly or impliedly by the master, then the act is the 
master’s, and, if the act was forcible and the

injury immediate, the remedy is Trespass.* Under the early decisions such as M’Manu,s 

v. Crickett~ the courts refused to hold the master liable for intentional misconduct on the part of the servant, on the 
theory that the fiction of an implied command of the master was inapplicable. But under modern law, in allocating 
the risk of the servant’s conduct, it has been held that wilful torts may be so connected with the employment as to 
fall within its scope.’°

Comparatively recently a case 11 of novel impression was considered involving the issue as to whether a wife could 
maintain an action under New Jersey law against the defendant for “maliciously enticing away the plaintiff's hus- 
band, and thereby alienating from her his affections.” It appeared that the Common-Law impediment as to remedy 
had been removed by a statute permitting a married woman to maintain an action in her own name, without joining 
her husband therein, for all torts committed against her or her separate property, in the same manner as if she were 
a feme sole.” In sustaining the wife’s action, Minturn, J., after alluding 
to the earlier, but incorrect view as to the origin of Case out of the Statute of Westminster II (1285),” concluded that the 
wife was entitled to vindicate her right in personam for a tort committed against her, and thus remedy the inequality 
to which she was subjected by the common law.

Deceit 
THE Declaration, in an action in an Action of Trespass on the Case for Deceit, must show the essential elements in 
the wrong,” to wit: 1. The specific false representations of material facts; 2. The scienter that the defendant knew his 
statements to be untrue; 15 3, That they were believed to be true by the plaintiff and were relied upon by him; 4. That 
the plaintiff acted thereon; and 5. That the plaintiff suffered damages by such action. 


It should appear that the damage is the result of the deceit.’ It is not sufficient to charge fraud generally, but the 
specific facts constituting the fraud must be set forth in some detail, including the actual misrepresentations. While 
it is not necessary to charge an intent to defraud, it should appear that the representations were intended or 
calculated to influence the plaintiff to act upon them."

769; lb. 771), it follows that the plaintiff must show, with reasonable certainty, in his Declaration, not only what the fraud was by which he has 
been injured, but also its connection with the alleged damage, so that it may appear judicially to the Court that the fraud and the damage 
sustain to each other the relation of cause and effect, or, at least, that the one might have resulted directly from the other.” Byard v. Holmes, 34

Malicious Prosecution - 

AT Common Law, when an injury is done to another maliciously, by the Process of a Court, as for example, in the 
case of a malicious arrest, & malicious prosecution of a criminal charge, or a malicious attachment of goods, the 
Action of Trespass on the Case is the proper remedy, if the Process was regular and the Court had jurisdiction; for 
there has been no trespass. It is said, however, that either Case or Trespass will lie if the Process was both malicious 
and unfounded, even though the Court had jurisdiction. Of course, the remedy is in Trespass, and not Case, where 
the Process or proceeding was irregular and void. 


In case for malicious prosecution, the Declaration must show that the original proseed was a pretence, and that the 
plaintiff was falsely 
and fraudulently deceived by It, is not suthcient, either in Criminal or Civil Cases, to fasten upon such matter the character of a false pretence, 
and that this can he done in no other way than by a distinct and specific averment of the falsehood of each separate matter of fact stated by the 
defendant, and intended to be denied by the plaintiff. 
What has been said with reference to the first Count will be found to apply in all respects, to the second and third, and, I think, substantially to 
the fourth Count also.” Byard v. Holmes, 34 N.J.L. 296, 299 (1870),

OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS 

strict and technical in regard to Declarations for Slander and Libel. This was true because the idea of defamation 
originated in the Civil Law, coming into English law through the Ecclesiastical or Church Courts, and hence the 
allawance of a remedy at Common Law for such actions invoked the rule of strict construction in pleading such 
causes. It was for this reason, that in declaring on contracts or other written instruments, the General Common Law 
Rule that the pleadcr night set out the instrument or writing verbatim, or according to its legal effect, was inap- 
plicable as to libel and slander cases; the libel or slander had to be set forth verbatirn.~° This rule, first adopted in 
England by the Criminal Court of Appeal was in time assimilated by the Civil Courts, and hence passed on down to 
modern time. The reason for this rule was that the Appellate Court could not tell whether the Lower Court had 
ruled correctly that the words spoken or written constituted libel or slander, as a matter of law, without having 
the very words as used in the Criminal Indictment before it. It was therefore required that the very words 
complained of be set out “in order that the court may judge whether they constitute a ground of action and also 


because the defendant is entitled to know the precise charge against him and cannot shape his ease until he knows.” 
21 


(IT) The Characteristics and Form of the Declaration in Slander.—Eecause the Common-Law Courts 
regarded libel and slander 


Zo. In declaring on Contracts or other Written Instruments the genus Common Law Rule is that the pleader must set out the Instrument sued upon 
verbatim, or in the words in which they were made, or according to their legal effect 1 Chltty, A Treatise on PleadIng, 229 (Springfield, 1833). 
To this General Rule there were two exceptions, to wit, in cases involving Negotiable Instruments and In Libel and Slander cases, the original 
Common Law Rule being that in such eases the words bad to be set out verbatim. It has, of course, been modified. 

U. Webster v. Rolmen, 62 N.S.L. 55, 40 A. 719 (1898). 


actions as an innovation, and applied the rule of strict construction in pleading such actions, it is no surprise to find 
that the Declaration in slander at Common Law consists of an elaborate and absurd jargon of recitals and 
explanations which obscure the real issues to be tried almost as effectually as if the pleadings were still drawn in 
Latin, as will appear from the form set out below:

clearly apply to the plaintiff, a colloquium is not necessary. In Milligan v. Thorn, 7 the plaintiff complained that he 
had been slandered, but he was not named in the slanderous words, The plaintiff therefore was required to include a 
colloquium, that a conversation was had of and concerning him. Without this nothing was expressed to which the 
innuendo could refer, when the plaintiff stated that he was intended.” 


(C) The Publication of the Scandal Itself. 

—As the basis of actions for libel and slander is damages for the injury to the character of the plaintiff in the 
opinion of others, and that can only arise where the words uttered or written are published to third persons, the 
declaration must allege publication of the slanderous or libelous matter. Thus, for 


25.6 Wend. (N.Y.) 412 (1581). 


-6. Where Defamatory language Is of a clear import and on its face applies to the plaintiff, no colloqulurn or setting is necessary in the 
Declaration. Choctaw Coal & Mining Co. v. Lullch, 204 Ala. 533, 56 South. 383, 11 ALa. 358; 17 R.C.L. 394. “Thus, if the imputation be that 
the plaintiff was ‘foresworn,’ this not being of itself actionable, because it does not necessarily impute the offense of perjury, it must be 


specifically alleged, by way of Inducement, that there had been a Judicial Proceeding, in which the plaintiff was a witness and gave 
evidence, and that the defendant when speaking the words, referred to such matter in using tho term ‘foresworn,’ and Intended to Impute 
that the plaintiff bad been guilty of the crime of perjury.” I Chitty, Pleading, 415. “Where the libelous matter can be collected from the 
words themselves, there need be no averment as to circumstances.” Thus, if the Declaration be, “lie perjured himself,” the charge of crime 
appears, and it Is for the defendant to plead its truth If he can. A Declaration was sustained by the King’s Beuch in 1661 as against a Motion 
in Arrest of Judgment which chnrged the defendant with saying of plaintiff, an attorney, “lie has no more Judgment in the Law than Mastcr 
Cheyny’s bull,” although it was urged that the Dcc' laration was defective In not alleging that Mr. Cheyny bad a bull, ned, non allocatur. 
Baker v Morphew, 2 Keble, 202, 84 Eng.Rep. 126. A charge, ironically made, that the plaintiff was an ‘toncut lawyer,” would have required 
more explanation, See Keigwlu, Precedents of PleadIng, 285, 295 (WashIngton, I). C. 1928). 

example, in Waistel v. Holman,” where the declaration averred that the defendant composed, wrote and delivered 

to the plaintiff a certain libel, addressed and directed to the plaintiff, a Demurrer was sustained, as the averment 

failed tọ show a publication of the libel; sending a sealed letter to the plaintiff was not a publication. 


(D) The Innuendo.—This part of the Declaration followed the colloquium, and its object was to explain the 


Page 213 of 735 


defendant’s meaning by reference to the previous statements in the inducement and colloquium; but an innuendo 
cannot enlarge the meaning shown by the inducement in which the surrounding conditions are set forth.” In Roella 
v. Follow,” the colloquium stated that “He” (meaning the plaintiff) “took a false oath,” but the Court held that 
the Declaration was inadequate in that the words were not in themselves actionable, and require an “innuendo 
which is necessary, in such cases, to explain the defendant’s meaning by reference to previous matter.” 


Œ) The Consequent Dantage&—This was merely a conclusion of the plaintiff that he had sustained damages 
to a certain amount, and therefore, he brings his suit. 


Over and above these technical parts of the Declaration, there were other requirements, Odgers,? in his famous 
work on Libel

2L Innuendoes ate not sufficient to supply the lack of Inducement and Colloquium or ettend the meaning of words beyond their natural import or 
sense. MacLaughlin v, Fisher, 136 Ill. 111, 116, 24 N.E. 60 Erettun v, Anthony, 103 Mass, 37 (1869); Whittier, Cases on Common Law

and Slander, states: “So, too, many other allegations were required describing the locality, the relationship between 
the various persons mentioned, and all the surrounding circumstances necessary to fully understand the defendant’s 
words. And these matters could not properly be proved at the trial unless they were set out on the record; if they were 
not, and the plaintiff had a verdict, the court would subsequently arrest judgment on the ground that it did not 
appear clearly on the face of the record that the words were actionable. And this technicality was carried to an 
absurd extent. Thus, where the defendant said, “Thou art a murderer, for thou art the fellow that dklst kill Mr. 
Sydnam’s man,’ the court of Exchequer Chamber, on error brought, arrested judgment, because there was no 
averment that any man of Mr. Sydnam’s had in fact been kille&*' Had the words been ‘and thou art’, instead of 
‘for thou art,’ the plaintiff would probably have been allowed to recover, Again, in Ball v. Roane (1598) 
Cro.Eliz, 308, the words were: “There was never a robbery committed within forty miles of Wellingborough 
but thou hadst thy part in it.’ After a verdict for the plaintiff, the court arrested judgment, ‘because it was not 
averred there was any robbery committed within forty miles, etc., for otherwise it is no slander.’ So in Foster v. 
Browning (1625) Cro.Jac. 688, where the words were, “Thou art as arrant a thief as any is in England,’ the court 
arrested judgment ‘because the plaintiff had not averred that there was any thief in England.’ But the climax was 
reached in a case cited in Dacy V. Clinch (1661) 1 Sid. 53, where the defendant had said to the plaintiff, ‘As sure as 
God governs the world, or Icing James this kingdom, you are a thief,’ After verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant 
moved in arrest of judgment, on

the ground that there was no averment on the record that God did govern the world, or King James this kingdom. But 
here the Court drew the line, and held that ‘these things were so apparent’ that neither of them need be averred.” 


(F) The Defamatory Words Themselves Must be Set Out Verbcttim.—At Common Law, the general rule was 
that in suing on written instruments, the contract could be set out verbatim or according to its legal effect. As setting 
forth a writing verbatim often resulted in a motion for nonsuit on the ground of variance between allegation and 
proof, usually the writing was set out according to its legal effect. But in libel and slander cases the words had to be 


Page 214 of 735 


alleged verbatim, or in haec verba. *? As we have stated earlier, this was due to the civil law origin of libel and 
slander, both of which were regarded as innovations upon the Common Law, and to the fact that the criminal and 
Appellate Courts, on review, could not determine whether the lower courts had properly determined whether the 
words uttered or written, as a matter of law, were slanderous or libelous. The defendant, of course, was also entitled 
to know the precise charge against him.” 


32. Webster ‘cc flolmes, 82 N.J.L. 55, 40 A. 778 (18985. See, also, Wormouth v. Cramer, S wend. (N.Y.) 394 (1829), where the words uttered 
were in the German language, but were set forth in the Declaration in the English language, with the rcsult that the plaintiff was Nonsuited. 


Proof of similar or equivalent words is not admissible. Wallace ‘cc Dixon, 82 DI. 202 (1876); Schultz ‘cc Short, 201 ill. App. 74 (19Th). But a 
slight variance Is not fatal; i. e., “You are a lar” is supported by proof that “You are a damned liar.” 25 Cyc. 
472. 


33. “The gravamen of an action for libel is not injury to the plaintiffs feelings, but damage to his reputation in the eyes of others. It Is not 
sufficient, therefore, that the plaintIff should understand himself to be referred to in the article. It is necessary to constitute libel that others 
than the plaintiff should he in a position to understand that the plaintiff Is the person referred to.” Duvivier v, French, 104 Fed. 278, 43 C.C.A. 
529 (1900).

OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Ch. 8 
(G) The Technical Common-Law kules of Pleading in Libel and Slander Modified.— Under modern practice 
the technicalities governing pleading in libel and slander eases 


have been largely abandoned. This tendency 
first took on substantial form in England when the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852 - provided: 


“In Actions of libel and slander, the plaintiff shall be at liberty to aver that the words or matter cornplainedof 
were used in a defamatory sense, specifying such defamatory sense without any prefatory averment to show how 
such words or matter were used in that sense, and such averment shall be put in issue by the denial of the alleged 
libel or slander; and where the words or matter set forth, with or without the alleged meaning, show a cause of 
action, the Declaration shall be sufficient.” 


This section was adopted into the New Jersey statutes in 1855.~~ 


The purpose of the above provision, as expounded by the courts of England and New Jersey, was to afford the 
plaintiff the right to set out in his Declaration the words complained of, and to place upon those words, by innuendo 
or specified defamatory sense, any construction he may see fit to attribute to them, without showing, by means of a 
colloquium, or other explanatory matter, how the words contained a defamatory charge.” “The effect of this 
change,” according to Lanning, 3., in Allen v. Oppenheimer,” “in the law of pleading, as to this class of cases, 
is that if the words complained of are actionable per se, and the plaintiff by innuendo puts a construction upon them 
different from what they would mean without the innuendo

Statutory Liability 

WHENEVER a Statute prohibits an injury to an individual, or enacts that he shall recover a penalty or damages 
for such injury, and is silent as to the form of remedy, an Action on the Case (and in some cases other actions) will 
lie.“ And if a statute gives a remedy in the affirmative, without a negative, express or implied, for a matter which 
was actionable in Case at Common Law, the party may still sue at Common Law.” But where a statute gives a new 
right, or creates a new liability, and prescribes a particular remedy, or if it prescribes a new remedy to enforce a 
Common-Law right, and expressly or impliedly excludes the Common Law remedy, the statutory remedy must be 
pursued.

Liability for Injuries by Animals 

AT Common Law, if a wild or vicious beast is turned loose, and mischief immediately ensues to the person or 
property of another, the injury is immediate, and Trespass, not Case is the remedy.“ But if a vicious animal is kept 
with knowledge of its dangerous propensities, and a person is thereby injured, the remedy is in Case.” Where, 
however, damage is done by a domestic animal, kept for use or convenience, the owner is not liable to action on the 
ground of negligence, without proof that he knew that the animal was accustomed to do mischief.” 


If the action for injury by an animal is in Trespass, it should contain a concise statement as to the injury 
complained of, whether to the person, or to the personal or real property, and should allege that such injury was 
committed with force and arms and against the peace.”°

ANTICIPATING DEFENSES IN CASE 
94. In some Jurisdictions the plaintiff must negative the possible existence of certain technical defenses, 
viz, contributory negligence, fellow-servant rule, and assumption of risk. 


IN some Jurisdictions it is necessary in a Declaration for negligence by a servant against the employer to negative 
the defenses of contributory negligence, fellow-servant rule, and assumption of risk. In Caluinet Iron and Steel 
Company v. Martin,” the general rule is declared to be that, in 
order to recover for injuries from negligence, it must be alleged and proved that the plaintiff was, at the time he was 
injured, observing ordinary care for his personal safety. After the period of the statute of limitations, the declaration 
cannot be amended to supply this “substantial fact.” sa In an Action of Trespass on the Case by a servant against 
his employer a Declaration was defective in 
Illinois and some other states which did not negative knowledge or assumption of risk.** It has been held that 
negativing knowledge of the risk is insufficient as it does not appear but that the servant had easy means of 
knowing.” 


In an action by a servant against his employer to recover for a personal injury for negligence, the declaration must 
negative the defense of the fellow-servant rule, if it is alleged that the negligent acts were done by the servants 
of the defendant without showing to what class they belonged. It is held, however, that if the allegations 
indicate

that the plaintiff was not a fellow servant,. no negative allegation is needed.” 


Page 217 of 735 


What the plaintiff must allege as a matter of pleading to state a cause of action is a more or less arbitrary 
matter. Since the plaintiff comes into court asking relief, it might seem that logically he should be required to set 
up and prove all the conditions essential to recovery, and that he should negative all possible defenses, such as con- 
tributory negligence, assumption of risk, and fellow-servant rule. In fact, however, the plaintiff is ordinarily only 
required to make out a prima facie case and need not refer to all the conditions, positive and negative, which are 
ultimately essential to a recovery. The plaintiff must show an apparent reason for his request and give fair notice 
of the facts relied on as the basis of his claim. This will, in general, indicate as to what matters the plaintiff has the 
burden of proof, which is a question of fairness, policy and convenience. Matters of justification and excuse are for 
the defendant to prove, since it is unfair to require the plaintiff to disprove the existence of each and all of them,” 
The defenses of contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and fellow-servant rule are technical at best and should 
not be favored by the rules of pleading. If they are to be raised at all, they should be set up affirmatively by the 
defendant.

TRESPASS ON TUE CASE 
203 


THE EXPANSIONISTIC CHARACTER 
OF CASE 


95. The Action of Trespass on the Case was adapted to many circumstances and factual situations which characterized 
the growth of society, and the ability of the law to meet the demands of a constantly advancing civilization largely has 
been made possible by the expansionistic character of this actzon. 


IT Is impossible to enumerate all the factual situations in which an Action of Trespass on the Case can be 
maintained, hence the particular applications of the action above discussed are merely illustrative of its enormous 
scope. It is referred to as the Great Residuary Remedy of the Common Law for the reason that the law has never 
placed a limitation on its continual expansion. As we have seen it was largely through the constant and ever 
increasing application of this action to a myriad of different factual situations involving a wrong not remediable by 
any other Form of Action which enabled the Judges of England to build up the Common Law of that country as it is 
known today. 


Before modern research revealed that Case did not originate out of the Statute of Westminster 77 (1285),~~ it 
was often suggested that a liberal construction of that Statute would have eliminated any need for the 
Chancellor’s extraordinary jurisdiction in filling out the alleged deficiencies of the Common Law, This 
suggestion was predicated upon the view that Equity originated out of the failure of the Common Law 
Courts to adapt themselves to the changes and needs of a developing society. It is submitted, however, 
that the view that Equity originated out of a failure of the Common Law Courts to so adapt themselves is 
wholly untenable and contrary to fact, for, as has been observed, the Common Law Courts could in no

event have afforded the kind of relief which Equity was eventually to offer without completely revolutionizing their 
procedures and enlarging their jurisdiction. 


Page 218 of 735 


What is true, however, is that the Action of Trespass on the Case revealed such great potentialities as to permit 
its adaptability to the many circumstances and factual situations which have characterized the growth of our 
society. Indeed, the ability of our law to meet the demands of our constantly 
advancing civilization largely has been made possible by the expansionistic character of this action. And, in this 
connection, it should be remembered that the capacity of this action has not been destroyed by the Reformed 
Procedure, under which the Single Action provided is in the Nature of an Action on the Case, and hence the process 
of expansion and growth continues at full pace. 


STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 


96. The Common Law Action of Trespass on the Case continues to exist under modern Codes, Practice Acts and 
Rules of Court, although the label, as such, has been removed. 


TI-fE Modem Status of the Action of Trespass on the Case appears plainly from two cases, one decided in 1939,~ 
the other in 
1951.~~ 


In the first case, Williamson v. Columbia Gas d Electric Cor’poration,°° in which the plaintiff complained 
that the acts of The Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation were in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act,” the 
section which barred corporations from acquiring, directly or indirectly, any stock of another corporation engaged 
in commerce,

where the effect would be to substantially lessen competition, the plaintiff also claimed threefold damages under 
Section 4 of the Clayton Act.”” The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that it did not state a 
cause of action which accrued within a period of three years prior to the Commencement of the Action. It was stip- 
ulated that the right of action accrued not later than January 1, 1931. The complaint having been dismissed by the 
District Court, the plaintiff appealed, thus raising a question as to whether the plaintiff's action was barred under the 
applicable Delaware Statute of Limitations,°’ Section 5129 of which provided: “No Action of Trespass, no Action of 
Repleviri, no Action of Detinue, no Action of Debt not found upon a Record or Specialty, no Action of Account, no 
Action of Assumpsit, and no Action upon the Case shall be brought after the expiration of three years from the 
accruing of the cause of such action.” 


In this situation the plaintiff concluded his action was in the nature of an Action of Debt on a Specialty and 
hence was not barred, having been brought within twenty years, the period prescribed by the Statute. The defendant 
argued that the complaint set forth a cause in tort for which an Action on the Case was the only remedy and that 
since the suit was brought more than three years after the action had accrued, recovery was barred by the Statute. 
Thus, in the Appeal, the issue of law was whether an Action in the Nature of Debt on a Specialty at Common Law 
might be brought to recover Damages for injuries to business resulting from acts prohibited by Section 7 of the 
Clayton Act; or whether an action in the Nature of the Common Law Action of Trespass on the Case was the 
sole remedy of the aggrieved party. 


62. 15 U.S.C. 15, 15 U.S.C.A. § 15. 


In affirming the Order of the District Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the action sounded in tort and that 
the appropriate Form of Action was the Common Law Action of Trespass on the Case. Chief Justice Mans declared: 


Page 219 of 735 


“In order to apply a statute of limitations, such as that of Delaware, which reads in terms of Common Law Actions, 
to a Civil Action brought in a District Court, it is necessary for the court through a consideration of the nature of 
the Cause of Action disclosed in the complaint to determine the Form of Action which would have been brought 
upon it at Common Law. It is evident that the complaint in the case before us discloses a Cause of Action which, 
under the Common Law of Delaware, would be enforceable in an Action on the Case and not in an Action of Debt 
on a Specialty. The District Court, therefore, properly held that the action was barred by the Delaware Statute of 
Limitations.” 


In the second case, Ei.sener v. Maxwell,” a Canadian case decided in 1951, the plaintiff s Statement of Claim 
alleged Damages caused by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle on a highway, to which the defendant pleaded 
that there had been no negligence. The Statute of Limitations for batteries was one year, and for causes which 
formerly would have been brought in the Form of Action Known as Trespass on the Case, six years. At the Trial 
the defendant urged that an action for personal injury was an Action I or Assault and Battery, and since it was 
brought after the expiration of one year, was barred by the Statute of Limitations. The plaintiff contended that 
automobile collisions on the highway should be treated as Actions of Negligence, and hence should be regarded as 


within the class which formerly would have been brought in the Form of Action called 
03. Revised Code of Delaware (1935). 
04. 28 VLI' .ttep. 213 (1051). 


TRESPASS ON THE CASE 
Trespass on the Case, and, therefore, was not barred, as it fell within the purview of that Section of the Statute of 
Limitations which prescribed a six year period of limitations. The Lower Court held for the defendant, but on Appeal, 
it was held that automobile collisions on the highway should be treated as giving rise to a new right of action to be 
known as an Action of Negligence. As such, it fell within the class which formerly would have been brought in the 
Form of Action Known as Trespass on the Case, and 
hence the six year Statute of Limitations applied. 


Thus, from the standpoint of a Federal case, decided in 1939, or a Canadian case, decided in 1951, It clearly 
appears that the Common Law Action of Trespass on the Case is very much alive under Modern Codes, 
Practice Acts, and Rules of Court, even though the label, as such, has been removed; and, what is more significant, 
is showing sufficient strength to create new substantive rights of action.

97. The Action of Trover, or Trover and Conversion, lies to recover Damages for the conversion by the 
defendant to his own use of specific personal property, of which the plaintiff was entitled to the immediate 
possession; the object of the action is the recovery of the ‘value of the property as Damages for its conversion; it is 
not the object of the action to recover Damages for the taking, nor is it the recovery of the property itself.

use.” As Detinue was subject to the disacivantages of Wager of Law and great particularity in the description of 
the chattel sought to be recovered, Trover, by a fiction of law—that is, by alleging a fictitious loss and finding—at 
length was allowed against any person who obtained possession of the personal property of another by any means 
whatever, and sold or used it without the consent of the owner, or refused to deliver it when demanded. The injury 
lies in the conversion or misappropriation of the goods, which is the gist of the action, and the statement of the 
finding is neither material nor traversable.* 


The object of the action is not the recovery of the property itself—that can be recovered only by Detinue or 
Replevin—but to recover the value of the property. Lord Mansfield, in Humbly v. Trott, said: “Trover is in Form a 
Tort, but in Substance an Action to Try Property. ..An Action of Trover ...

is founded on property.” ~ It is thus a substitute for a property action to recover the possession~ in short it makes the 
converter a compulsory purchaser.” 


In Trespass the plaintiff is compensated by Damages measured by the actual harm done to the goods or chattels 
or the use lost; in Trover the injured party is compensated by Damages measured by the entire value of the property 
involved at the time of the conversion. 


The manner in which the defendant may have obtained possession of the property is no longer material. The 
Form of the Action supposes that the possession may have been obtained lawfully, that is, by a bailment or a finding, 
but it lies as well where the possession was obtained by a Trespass. In such a case, however, the plaintiff, by bringing 
Trover, waives the Trespass; and no Damages are recoverable for the act of taking; they are recoverable only for the 
wrongful act of conversion.° 


PROPERTY WHICH MAY BE CONVERTED 

98. Trover may be maintained for all kinds of personal property, including legal documents, but not 
where articles are severed from land by an adverse possessor, at least until after tIre land has been recovered, It lies 
for the misappropriation of specific money, but not for the breach of an obligation to pay where there is no 
duty to return specific money. 


THE Action of Trover is confined to the conversion of personal property. It does not lie, therefore, for the 
appropriation of fixtures stiR annexed nor for any injuries to

between landlord and tenant, mortgagor and mortgagee, vendor and purchaser, etc., property may remain personal

TROVER—TJISTINGUISHED FROM AND 
CONCURRENT WITH OTHER 
ACTIONS 


99. fly the successive extensions over a period of time of the action of Trover, by the close of the Eighteenth Century it had 
become a 


concurrent remedy with Detinue, Replevin and Trespass de Bonis Asportatis. Each of these remedies had their own 
peculiar characteristics and Trover was not completely coextensive with them. 


THE Action of Detinue, in its broadest scope, and the Action of Trespass failed to adequately protect the rights of 
owners in their chattels. Thus, if a bailee or other person in possession misused the goods of the bailor in such a way 
as to impair their value, and thereafter, at the request of the bailor, surrendered them, the only remedy available to 
the bailor was an Action on the Case, if he desired to recover full Damages.’° Of course, if, after diminishing the 
value of the chattels, the bailee still refused to deliver them upon the demand of the owner, Detinue was available, 
in which the owner might recover the chattels or their value, with Damages for the unlawful detention. But if the 
defendant saw fit to restore the chattels under the judgment and the owner wished to recover Damages for the injury 
or diminished value of the chattels, he was forced to bring Case. By bringing Case in the first instance, the owner 
was able to avoid a multiplicity of actions.” Originally, where the chattel bailed found its way from the bailee

into the hands of a third party and was destroyed, the bailor, it was said, could not recover in Detinue, as it was 
regarded as impossible to show a detention where the goods had been previously destroyed. Whatever doubt 
prevailed on the point as to whether Case would lie in favor of the owner in this situation was ultimately resolved in 
favor of permitting the action.” It having now been held that Case would lie against any possessor for misusing the 
goods, and any possessor other than a bailee for the destruction of the goods, it was bound to follow that such an 
action would be permitted against a bailee who destroyed the goods, which occurred in a case decided in 1479.22 
In a case decided in 1510 23 it was held that a wrongful sale by a bailee would amount to a conversion, and in 
Vancirinic v. Archer,” the same effect was given to a sale by a finder, as a result of which Trover became 
established as a concurrent remedy with Detinue in those cases involving a misfeasance. 


The next step was for Trover to become 
concurrent with Trespass. Basset v. Rlaynard >sheld in the year 1601 that Trover would lie for a wrongful taking, 
and in 1604, in the case of Bishop v. Montague,” it was held that the plaintiff might elect between

Moore, Cro.Car. 89, 79 Eng ltep. 678 (1627), In which the Justices and Barons declared that “although he took it ~ ~ trespass, yet the other 
may charge him in Sn AcUrni upon the case In Trover If he will.” 


Trover or Trespass. And in 1596, in the case of Eason v. I’ lewman,~ Trover was permitted against a finder, even 
though the original taking was not adverse, on the ground of refusal to surrender the goods on demand of the owner, 
it having been earlier held that Trespass could be maintained as the taker was a trespasser ab initlo. Ames suggests, 
however, that the action was allowed as a substitute for Trespass, and not as an alternative of Detinue, a 
conclusion based on the fact that for many years thereafter Prover was not permitted against a bailee who refused to 
deliver the chattel to the bailor upon request. But after various negative holdings, in 1675, it was held that Trover 
was available against the bailee on mere demand and denial.” Under the foregoing decisions, Trover became a 
concurrent remedy with Detinue, except where the bailee was unable to deliver the goods as they had been 
negligently lost; in such a case the bailee was liable in Assumpsit. The net result, therefore, was that Trover, not 
being subject to Wager of Law, was substituted in lieu of Detinue, until after the early part of the Nineteenth 
Century. One further conquest remained to be made, although Trover had now been extended to cover the Field of 
Both Detinue and Trespass. After Trespass became concurrent with Replevin, which lay for a wrongful distress, 
Prover followed suit and also became available on the theory that a wrongful distress constituted a conversion.” 


Thus, Trover had finally emerged as a remedy concurrent with Detinue, Replevin 
and Trespass, and supplemented by Case and Assumpsit.

FORM OF TUE DECLARATION IN TROVER

the Action in some respects follows the Form of Case. The Form of the Original Writ and so also the Early 
Forms of the Declaration contained a statement that the defendant had acted to deceive and defraud the plaintiff. The 
statement as to the Loss and Finding ultimately became immaterial when Trover was extended to cover any 
wrongful taking, and thereafter was dropped.

Page 226 of 735 


ALLEGATIONS: (1) IN GENERAL 
101. The Essential Allegations of the Declaration in Trover are: 

(I) The plaintiff s Possession or Right of Immediate Possession of certain goods, with description; the de- 
scription of the property converted and the plaintiff’s right thereto, must be sufficient for purposes of 
identification, but the plaintiff’s property or right may be stated generally; 

(II) The Conversion, including in some cases Demand and Refusal; 
(III) The Value of the Goods and Damages 


by their Conversion. 


OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS

ALLEGATIONS~ (2) TUE PLAINTIFF’S 
RIGHT, TITLE, INTEREST OR POSSES 
SION 

192. The plaintiff must have the Eight to the Immediate Possession. A defrauded seller may regain his Right 
of Possession by election to rescind the sale. The Right of Possession may arise front a bailment or from bare 
possession itself. A mere servant has custody, not possession. The Right of Possession is sometimes spoken of as 
Constructive Possession. 


Title and Possession to Support Ti-over 

IN order to maintain this Form of Action, it is commonly said that the plaintiff must, at the time of the 
conversion, have had a Property, either General or Special, in the chattel, and also the actual possession, or the right 
to the immediate possession.*° “Special Property” may arise from a bailment or even from bare possession. The 
immediate right of possession as against the wrongdoer is all the property right necessary. 


It is sufficient that the plaintiff at the time of the conversion had the right to immediate possession, arising either 
from the actual possession or from title of any sort.”

If goods are obtained by fraud, the vendor may avoid the sale, and bring Trover against the vendee, at least after a 
demand and refusal to return the goods, and, by the weight of authority, without a previous demand.' It must be 
borne in mind, however, that if the contract is affirmed, with knowledge of the fraud, by bringing assumpsit or 


otherwise, the property passes irrevocably, and therefore Trover will not lie.”

ACTION OF TROVER 


213 
A bailee or any person in possession of goods may maintain Trover against a stranger who takes them out of his 
possession)” The action will therefore lie by an officer who had the possession of, and a special property in, the 
goods by virtue of an Execution or Writ of Attachment; ~ or by a carrier, a warehouseman,”” a consignee, N a gratui- 
tous bailee,*° or by any agent who is responsible over to his principal.” 


The finder of goods has a Special Property in them which will enable him to maintain Trover against any one but 
the true owner.”

against a mere stranger. 


The rule by which a bailee, finder, or wrongful possessor is permitted to sue and recover Damages which he has not 
sustained, and by such recovery bar a subsequent action by the bailor for an injury to his general property 
without his consent, is criticized as unsound by certain authorities." It is suggested that the General Owner and the 
one having a special property should each bring an action for the actual loss or damage to his own particular 
interest. This might well be the rule where the person in possession does not claim complete Title, or where the 
General Owner does not consent to his recovering the total loss. Indeed, it is recognized that the mere naked bailee, at 
the will of the bailor, cannot recover against a third person for the conversion of the bailed property, where the bailor 
or owner has intervened and asserted his general property. It is otherwise in the case of a bailee with the right of 
possession for a specific time and purpose, who has the

right to recover to the extent of the value of his special interest in the property, even where the general owner 
intervenes.“ It does seem strange that a bailee is entitled to recover for the entire Damage done to property by its 
injury, loss or misappropriation, while a joint owner of personal property, who sues without joining the other co- 
owners, is entitled to recover only his own Damage. But it is generally recognized that “the peace and order of 
society require that perSons in possession of property, even without Title, should be enabled to protect such pos- 
session by appropriate remedies against mere naked wrongdoer&*~” Thus the United States Government, in carrying 
on the post office, is bailee of the letters and their contents for hire, and has sufficient interest to maintain an Action 
of Trespass or Trover against a thief or wrongdoer for disturbing that possession, like any other bailee, and may 
recover the entire value of the property.*° 


A person having a special property in goods, and being entitled to the possession as against the general owner, 
as in the case of a pledgee for value, a chattel mortgagee after condition broken, or a bailee having a lien, may 
maintain Trover even against the General Owner, or against one who has converted the goods by authority of, or on 
Process against, the General Owner.”!

Constructive Possession or Right to Possession; 

IN order to maintain Trover, the plaintiff must have had possession, or the right to immediate possession, at the 
time of the conversion.*° One is said to have constructive possession when he is given the same rights and remedies as 
if he were In actual possession. This may be the case of an owner when no one is in actual possession, or when some 
bailee at will is in possession subject to his orders. 


Where the property was, at the time of the conversion, in the hands of a bailee at will, Trover may, in most cases, 
be maintained

The right to possession must have been inunediate, absolute and unconditional, and not dependent on some act to be done by the plaintiff. It is not 
enough that the plaintiff had a good right of action, or a right to take possession at some future day. Frink v. Pratt, 130 Ill. 327, 22 N.E. 819

either by the General or the Special Owner— that is, by the bailor or bailee—though a Judgment obtained by one of 
them will be a Bar to an action by the other~° But this is not the case where the bailee has the exclusive right of 
possession as against the baflor. 

Therefore, where goods leased as furniture with a house were taken in Execution against a former owner, and 
sold by the sheriff, it was held that the landlord could not maintain Trover against the sheriff pending the lease, but 
should have brought an Action on the Case, as the right of possession was in the tenant? A landlord, however, 
generally has such a right of possession of timber wrongfully cut down during the lease as to enable him to maintain 
Trover if it is removed.” 


The person who has the absolute or general property in goods may maintain Trover, though he has never had the 
actual possession, provided he had the right to immediate possession. The general ownership with the right to 
possession creates a constructive possession.” Thus, where a person has de

liverS goods to a carrier or other bailee, who has not the right to withhold the possession from the General Owner, 
he may maintain Trover for conversion by a stranger, for the owner has the constructive possession.M So an 
executor or administrator has constructive possession of the goods of his testator or intestate from the time of his 
death; ~ a trustee of goods has constructive possession, though they are in the actual possession of the cestui que 
trust; --a consignee of goods, who is also the vendee, may bring Trover for their conversion after their delivery to 
the carrier, arid before he has acquired actual possession; s- and the vendee of goods, where the property in them has 
passed, may maintain the action for their conversion before they left the actual possession of the vendor.” 


If the bailee of goods, having the right to their possession, as against the bailor, so that the bailor could not in 
general maintain Trover for their conversion, so deals with 
them as to terminate the bailment, the bailor 
acquires constructive possession, and for their subsequent conversion he may maintain Trover. Thus, where the

under an agreement by which the lessee might return or purchase them at the end of the term, and before the term had

A bailor may maintain an action of trover against the bailee, if by wrongful use or disposal of the goods the 
bailee has repudiated his obligations, and thereby enabled the bail-or to exercise the rights and remedies of a 
person entitled to possession. If a bailee misappropriates the property, as by selling or pledging it as his own, the 
bailor may immediately Elect to treat the bailment as ended and bring trover for its Value, or he may Elect to treat 
the bailment as continuing and sue for Damages. A bailee, if he has any right of enjoyment or use, must use the 
thing in moderation, and not exceed the limits of the bailment. If his acts imply an assertion of Title or right of 
dominion inconsistent with the bailor’s ownership, this is a conversion of the property. Mere misuse, or 
unauthorized use of the thing bailed without adverse claim, or negligent loss, may only amount to a breach of 


Page 231 of 735 


obligation, or a tort in the Nature of Waste, falling short of conversion. 


Title in a Third Partij as a Defence 

IN Trespass and Trover at Common Law there was some difficulty as to whether Title in a Third Party was a 
good Defence. As 
Trespass is based on possession, the Defence of Title in a Third Person was obviously not good. But in Trpver the 
situation may be different where the plaintiff, not being in possession,~° is relying on his right to posses- 


59. Grant v. King, 14 Vt. 367 (1842). See, also, Turner v. Waldo, 40 Vt. 51 (1867). 


00. If the plaintiff in Trover Is relying on possession, title in a third party may not be pleaded success- 

sion. In the latter case, the defendant may sometimes effectively take issue as in the case of Leake v. Loveday,” in 
which A was the holder of a bill of sale upon furniture belonging to B, the effect of the bill being to leave the 
possession of the furniture in B, but to convey the ownership to A,, with a provision that if B failed to pay the 
money due under the bill, A should have an immediate right to possession. B went into bankruptcy, whereupon the Title 
to the furniture, being still in his “order and disposition,” passed to his assignees in bankruptcy. Before the 
assignees could liquidate, the furniture was seized on Execution, in satisfaction of a debt which B owed to other 
creditors. In this situation A, relying on his bill of sale, sued the defendant-sheriff, who took under the Execution, in 
Trover, only to be met with the Defence that Title was. in Third Parties—the assignees in bankruptcy. In 
holding the Defence good, it 

was pointed out that since the plaintiff was not in possession he necessarily had to make out his right to immediate 


possession, and hence by Way of Defence the sheriff could plead the Superior Title of the assignees in bankruptcy, 
even though he was not acting under their authority.

to allege that the defendant injured or took the plaintiff's goods and chattels without showing their number or nature. 
In Trover, Trespass, and Case less particularity is required than in Detinue or Replevin, in which the plaintiff seeks to 
recover the goods themselves, The price or value should be stated, though it has been held that the omission to do so 
will not be fatal.” The time should also be alleged, though it seems that it is only essential to show a time before 
suit broughtM It is usual to state that the plaintiff, being possessed of such goods as are described, on a certain day, 
casually lost the same out of his possession, and that afterwards, on the day and year aforesaid, they came into the

DECLARATION IN TROVER—ESSENTIAL 
ALLEGATIONS: (3) THE DEFENDANT’S WRONGFUL ACT OF CONVERSION 
103. The Declaration should allege a Conversion by the defendant to his own use, contrary to the Rght of the 
plaintiff, A Conversion may be: 


Œ By wrongfully taking and carrying away goods, or assuming a dominion over them, or otherwise 
depriving the owner of them, 
(ID By wrongfully assuming the control, or dominion over, or right to dispose of goods, of which the 
actual possession has been lawfully obtained. 
(IID By merely wrongfully Cetaining goods lawfully obtained. In this case, and in this case only, a demand and 
refusal to restore the goods are necessary before bringing the Action. A demand and refusal are not 
necessary to make a Conversion where the defendant has already done an Act of Conversion. 


The Nature of Conversion. 

A CONVERSION of the property is the gist of the Action of Trover, and is always essential to support it. It is for 
the conversion of the goods by the defendant to his own use, not for the act of taking them, that Damages are 
recoverable. For the act of taking, the remedy is Trespass. 


To constitute a conversion, it is necessary 
that he shall have, in some sense, n,isappropriated or assumed adverse dominion over 


65. Royce v. Oakes, 20 R.T. 252, 38 A. 371 (1897). 


A General Demurrer to a Petition in an Action for Converslon which avers facts showing that the 
plaintiff has a General or Special Property in the chattels alleged to have been converted, the right of possession thereof at the time of 


converslon, and that the defendant lass converted the seine to his own use, Is properly overruled. Wire v. Siocum, 80 Okla. 111, 104 P. 
1061 (1921).

the goods and deprived the owner of them.” A conversion may take place in the following ways: 


Œ) By a Wrongful Taking and Carrying Away or Destruction —The wrongful taking, it folloWed by a 
removal or carrying away or assumption of dominion, of the goods of another, who has the right of immediate p05- 
session, is of itself a conversion; and so is the compelling of a party to deliver up goods, and carrying them away. 
The wrongdoer need not further use or dispose of the goods.” It has been said that, wherever Trespass will lie for

taking goods of the plaintiff wrongfully, Trover will also lie; but this is not so. Trespass and Trover are concurrent 
remedies for the wrongful taking of goods where there has been a complete carrying away,”

Trover does not lie where the plaintiff has the possession, and the defendant, who had the Legal Title, has merely assorted it by a sale, without an 
actual taking or delivery of possession. Massachusetts:

The collection of a note by one who has no interest in it is a conversion, Chiekering v. Raymond, 15

but not otherwise. A conversion is not necessary to support trespass, but it is necessary to support Trover. A mere 
seizure of goods by a stranger, who immediately relinquishes possession, even though there was some asportation, 
will support Trespass, but not Trover, for there is no conversion.” If, by a mere seizure without a carrying away, 
the possession is changed in law, then there is a conversion. Trover will therefore lie where goods are wrongfully 
seized, as a distress, though there is no removal of them.’° 


Trover lies to recover the value of goods obtained by the defendant from the plaintiff by fraud. Replevin will also 
lie. This in effect is the specific enforcement of the duty of the fraudulent buyer to return the goods and the 
corresponding right of the seller to immediate possession.” 


(ID By a Wrongful User, or Assumption of Title.-..-.Again, the wrongful assumption of the property in goods, or 
dominion over them or right of disposing of them, may be a conversion in itself, though actual possession may have

In other cases, where the defendant had the rightful custody of the goods in the first instance, and his detention is 


relied upon as a conversion, it is essential for the plaintiff to show that he made a proper demand for the goods 
and that the defendant refused to deliver them to him, 


A demand and refusal are necessary in all cases where the defendant became, in the first instance, lawfully 
possessed of the goods, and the plaintiff cannot show some distinct misuse or misappropriation. Thus, where goods 
are delivered under a contract, as to do something with them, and return them when completed, the mere omission to 
perform the contract is not in itself a conver(Va.) 80, 19 Am.Dec. 739 (1829); Vermont: Riford

ACTION OF TROVER 
223 
DECLARATION IN TROVER—ESSENTIAL 
ALLEGATIONS: (4) THE DAMAGES 

104. The Declaration must state the Damages which are the legal and natural consequence of the 
Conversion and the amount laid should cover the value of the goods and other actual Damages. 


THE amount of Damages which is recoverable in this action is usually measured by the value of the goods at the 
time of conversion, with interest; ~ but the plaintiff is en-tilled to include also any other loss that is its legal and 
naturai consequence, if not too remote, and the statement therefore should be large enough to cover the actual 
Damages inflicted.” 


there may be a right to detain the goods, as where the party has a lien on them. The reason for the refusal, in such a case, should be stated. 
Kellogg s’. Holly, 29 II, 437 (1862). 


One in the possession of property may always claim a lien upon It, or he may have the right to satisfy himself, as any prudent man would do, that 
the party demanding it is the real owner, or the proper agent to receive it. English: Mills v. Ball, 2 Bos. & P. 464, 126 Eng.Rep. 1382 (1801);

The general rule that the plaintiff cannot recover a larger amount than he alleges to be due in his Declaration is, of course, applicable to Trover. 
I. H. Pitts & Son Co. v. Bank of Shiloh, 20 Ga.App. 143, 92 SE. 775 (1917). 


In Trover, without any specific ad thtmnitm clause in the Declaration, but with a prayer that the defendant appear and answer, the amount of 
Damages asked for will be construed to be the alleged value of the property sued for. 1. H. Pitts & Son Co. v. Bank of Shiloh, 20 GtApp. 
143, 92 SE, 775 (1917). 


92. An Allegation that the Conversion was “to the great Damage” of the plaintiff, has been held sufficient [MattIngly v. Darwin, 23 III. 618 
(1860)], though this, It would seem, could only be because the statement bad been made elsewhere than In the ad damnun. clause, of 
the value of the goods, as 
The defendant may lessen the amount of the recovery by showing, in Mitigation of Damages, that the plaintiff 

has himself recovered the property, or that it has been restored to him and accepted; but this is matter of Defense, and 

the Allegation of the Declaration must still be made.°° As in other actions, the Form of Laying Damages will vary, 
depending on whether they are General or Special. The plaintiff might recover Special Damages in Trover, if they 

were laid in the Declaration. And the Jury might, on the Trial or Inquisition of Damages, by authority of a 

statute,” give Damages in the nature of interest over and above the value of the goods at the time of the conversion 

or seizure, in an actions of Trover or Trespass de Bonis Asportatis. 


STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 
105. While the Codes and Practice Acts have taken the labels from the various Common 
Law Actions, and thereafter every action became in form a Special Action on the Case, the intrinsic differences between the 
actions as 
known to the Common Law were not abolished. Hence, if a plaintiff sues, under the 


some averment was certainly necessary as a basis 
of computation.

THE Status of the Action of Trover under the Modern Law was clearly stated a few years after the adoption of 


Page 240 of 735 


the New York Code in 1848, in the case of Goulet v. AssetC?’.°~ In that case, the plaintiff, a mortgagee of chattels 
which had been sold under an execution against the mortgagor, brought the action, in the nature of Trover or 
Trespass, on the theory that the defendant had taken, sold and converted the goods to his own use, and that plaintiff 
was entitled to recover the vaiue of the goods. At the Trial, the Court instructed the Jury to assess the value of the 
goods, and to find a Verdict for the plaintiff for that value, subject to the opinion of the Court, with power to 
dismiss the Complaint. The Jury fixed the value of the property at $850.00 and the Court at General Term entered 
Judgment for this amount, whereupon the defendant appealed. In reversing the Judgment and granting a New Trial, 
SeMen,

95. 22 N.Y. 225 (1860). 


94. The advantage of an Action of Trover as opposed to an Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit for the collection of a debt, is clear. It gives or 
gave a right to hold to bait during the pendency of the action; and a right to imprisonment upon Execution, In addition to the usual 
resort to the property of the defendant. Salt Springs National Bank v. Wheeler, 43 N.Y. 492, S Am.Rep. 564 (1872). 


See, also, Sectioa 6101 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (1963), which provides for an order for the arrest of a defendant, other 
than a woman, as a provisional remedy, 'whcre there Is a cause of 

tween the mere Forms of Action, and every Action is now in Form a Special Action on the Case, yet actions vary in 
their nature, and there are intrinsic differences between them which no law can abolish, It is impossible to make 
an action for a direct aggression upon the plaintiff’s rights, by taking and disposing of his property, the same thing, 
in substance or in principle, as wi action to recover for the consequential injury resulting from an improper inter- 
ference with the property of another, in which he has a contingent or prospective interest. The mere Formal 
Differences between such Actions are abolished; the substantial Differences remain as before. The same proof, 
therefore, is required in each of these Two Kinds of Actions, as before the Code, and the same rule of Damages ap- 
plies. Hence, in an action in which the plaintiff establishes a right to recover, upon the ground that the defendant has 
wrongfully converted property to the possession of which the plaintiff was entitled at the time of the conversion, the 
proper measure of 

Damages still is, the value of the property; while in an action in which the plaintiff recovers, if at afl, upon the ground 
that the defendant has so conducted himself in the exercise of a legal right in respect to another’s property, as 
unnecessarily and improperly to reduce the value of a lien, which the plaintiff could only enforce at some 
subsequent day, the damages must, of course, depend upon the extent to which that lien has been unpaired.”

SCOPE OP THE ACTION 
106. The Action of Ejeetment lies to recover possession of Real Property adversely held by the defendant. In 
order that the Action may be maintained: 
D 


The Plaintiff must have the right to possession at the time the Action commenced; prior possession is 
sufficient as against a mere intruder or trespasser. 

(ID) The plaintiff must have been dispossessed or ousted. 

(ID And the defendant must be in the adverse and illegal possession of the land, actual or constructive, at 

the time the Action is brought. 

In the absence of a Statutory Provision to the contrary, merely Nominal Damages are given for the 
dispossession in the Action of Ejectnient proper. The Mesne Profits, during the 
defendant’s possession, must be recovered at Common Law in a separate Action of Trespass for Mesne Profits, 
or by some similar remedy, In many Jurisdictions, by Statute, Mesne Proilts and other Damages may be, and in 
some, must be recovered in the Action of Ejectment proper.

forded a number of remedies in the Form of some one of the Ancient Real Actions,” such, for example, as the Writ 
of Novel Disseisin, under which, if carefully selected and patiently pursued, he might recover possession and 
establish his Right or Title The lessee of a term, or the holder of a non-freehold estate, however, if ousted, might

recover only Damages for the wrongful ouster, but he could not regain possession of the land, nor could he, in that 
Form of Action, recover

ACTION OF EJEOTMENT 
227 
Damages for Mesne Profits'—the subsequent rents and profits between the date of the original ouster and the date of 
the recovery of possession. 


To provide an adequate remedy for the holder of a Non-freehold Estate, the Action known as Trespass for 
Ejectment was developed. But at this point, it should be pointed out that this Newly Developed Remedy was 
available only to the holder of a Non-freehold Estate, to wit, a tenant for years, who was regarded as having only a 
mere Chattel interest and not an interest in Real Estate; it was not available to vindicate the right of one who was 
asserting Title to a freehold interest in land. If the plaintiff desired to try Title to the land in question, he was still re- 
quired to invoke one of the Ancient Real Actions,’ which, as we have pointed out in an earlier chapter, were highly 
dilatory, expensive and unduly technical.” 

In the fifty to a hundred years after 1499, the year in which it was held that the tenant could recover the Term as well as 
Damages, this New Action of Trespass for Ejectment 


& Keigwin, Cases in Common Law Pleading, c. IT, The Common Law Actions, The Action of Ejectment, 123 (2d ed., Rochester 1934). 
~- These Actions, some sixty in number, arc discussed in Chapter 2, The Development of the Common Law Forms of Action. 


& “The Common Law furnished an endless number of Real Writs to determine the rights of property in, or possession of, a freehold estate. The 
highest technical skill and learning were requisite to comprehend and define the nature and purposes of these various writs, the distinctions 
between which were refined, abstruse and often scarcely perceptible. In Personal Actions, however, there were never many Writs at Common 
Law. This very scarcity made personal actions attractive in early times, the pleader being seldom at a loss to know which Writ to choose; while 
in Real Actions the most experienced practitioner, exercising the utmost care, frequently sued out a Real Writ of the wrong degree, class or 
nature, thereby rendering the proceeding of no avail, and frequently Imperilling the demandant’s right to the proper writ or remedy. Not only 
were the distinctions between Real Writs very technical, and the selection of the proper writ a delicate task, but 


became such an effective instrument for trying the Right of Possession which, in substance, amounted to trying 
Title, that the landlords, who, in Legal Contemplation, already had an Adequate Remedy, in the Form of the Real 
Actions,’ for the recovery of Possession, began to seek ways and means whereby the New Remedy—now known as 
Ejectment—and open only to the holders of non—freehold estates, might be made available to the holders of 
freehold estates, without violating the Common-Law theory that the remedy was available solely for the use of 
non-freehold owners. 


This end was to be accomplished by working out a scheme whereby the Action of Trespass Quare Ejectione 
F’irmae—Trespass for Ejectment—could be adapted to the use of the owners of freehold estates without violating 
the fundamental theory of the action 
—that it was available only to the owners of non-freehold interests in land. And it was the ensuing effort which 
ushered on to the stage of procedural legal history the law’s most famous fiction—the Fictitious Proceeding in 
Ejectment—which did not reach full fruition except as an incident of passing through three stages of development: 


Page 243 of 735 


First, wherein there was no fiction whatever involved; second, where there was a resort to fiction, but wherein the 
steps upon which the fiction was grounded were actually true in 


the proceedings under them were so inconveniently long, tedious and costly, and the resources for delay so numerous, that the Judgment when 
obtained was often a tardy and inadequate remedy.” Sedgwick and Wait, Principles and Practice Governing the Trial of Title to Land, c, I, ~ 2, 
p. 3 (New York, 1882). 


7. The Common Law believed in an economy of remedies. Where the Law supplied @ remedy to a given group of litigants, like the owners of 


freehold estates, they were generally limited to that remedy. When, therefore, the New Action of Trespass for Eiectment was created, there 
naturally followed a period of time during which the new remedy remained unavailable to the holders of freehold estates.

(I) Where the Requisite Conditions to Support Trespass Quare Ejectione Firmae were Actual.—Where A, 
a freeholder, actually leased I3lackacre to B, who took actual possession, and was thereafter disseised, B, the tenant, 
might bring an Action of Trespass for Ejectment. C, the disseisor, usually defended by asserting a Title paramount to 
that of A, the lessor. Thus, the merits of B’s Title under A, and C’s title, were brought into opposition and 
comparison, as an incident of B’s claim to a right of possession. The Judgment which followed necessarily 
determined who had the true Title. And by this process the landlord, through the suit of his tenant, B, against C, for 
interference with B’s possession, in effect avoided the necessity of instituting a Real Action.’ 


(ID Where the Requisite Conditions to Support Trespass Quare Ejectione Firmae were Fictitious, but 
Grounded on True Facts, 

—It was soon discovered that the same result could be achieved by resort to a fictitious proceeding which, however, 
in the beginning, was based on a true state of facts, The scheme devised worked substantially as follows. The 


Landlord, 4 desiring to try Title to land not previously under lease, recruited two friends or collaborators, .4 and B, 
who then made an actual Entry upon the land, subsequently to be spoken of as the Entry, Such Entry was required 
in order to avoid being charged with the common-law crime known as maintenance,”° or promoting

L See Keigwln, Cases In Common Law Pleading, e. II, The Common Law Actions, § 52, The Action of Ejeetment, note 6 (2d 
ed,, Rochester 1934). 


19. “It Is a general rule, that no right of entry, OF re-entry, can be reserved, or given to any other person, than the feeffer, donor or 
lessor, Ac, and their heirs; and suck rJ ght of entry cannot be assigned 


lawsuits, as every lease of real estate by an owner not in possession was bound to result in some form of action. AA 
and B, now being on the land in question, L, the real disseisor, then handed an actual lease of the premises to A, 
hereinafter to be known as the Lessee, and then instructed B, hereinafter to be known as the Casual Ejector, to eject 
A, the lessee, which he proceeded to do, all of which activity was unknown to the Actual Tenant of the premises, Z. 
Thereafter, A, the tenant selected by L, the landlord, instituted a suit against B, his disseisor, under the scheme. 
Thus, the official line-up became A, ex dem. (lessee of) /~, the landlord, v. B, the Casual Ejector. As B put up no 
Defense, Judgment was entered for A, a Writ of Execution issued against Z, the actual tenant, and A was placed in 
possession, after which he surrendered his lease to the landlord. The student should observe at this point that so far 
there has been no feigning of the facts. The plaintiff made a bona tide Entry into the land under dispute, thereafter on 
the land he executed an actual Lease to a real lessee, who immediately took possession, after which he was actually 
ejected, Thus, every element of the case was of actual occurrence. 


And! thus, by this process, the landowner was able to try Title to the land in question, without violating the 
theory that the Action of Trespass for Ejectment was available only to the owner of a non-freehold estate, as A, the 
fictitious lessee, and the nominal plaintiff (the landlord was the real plaintiff, al-.

against maintenses, the subversion Of justice, and the oppression of the poor, by the rich and powerful. For if me’~ were allowed to grant

though not a party to the action) was, so far as the Record went, the holder of a non-freehold or leasehold estate. 


It is not surprising, therefore, to find that both Court and Counsel eagerly availed themselves of the loophole thus 
discovered by means of which questions concerning Titles to land which ordinarily could be raised only in some one 
of the numerous and technical Real Actions, might now be brought and determined in a purely Personal Action, with 
the same results of a Real Action achieved in a simple Action of Trespass, at least so far as possession was 
involved.” In referring to this very point, Sedgwick and Wait aptly declared: “The history of procedure nowhere 
presents a more curious fact than that the owners of the soil [freeholders] should have suddenly relinquished a 
system of remedies [the Ancient Real Actions]; which had been matured by the experience of centuries, and have 
consented to try Titles to the freehold in a Personal Action, originally devised to protect the precarious estates of the 
inferior tenantry.” 12 


This rapid change in procedure, which began in the reign of Henry VIII (1509—1547) 
ultimately resulted in the obsolescence of the Real Actions, once it was realized that Ejectment was an efficient 
instrument for trying the right of possession, and that, in the final analysis, no title could be tried without also trying 
possession. There was also the additional advantage that Ejectment being a Personal Action, might be instituted in 
either King’s Bench or Exchequer, whereas the old Real Actions for trying Title could only be brought in the Court of 
Common Pleas. And, as in Assumpsit and Trover, now also just coming into vogue, the pleading in Ejectment was 
genera], with the result that there was small risk of a disastrous variance.

D Where the Requisite Conditions to Support Trespass Quare Ejectione Fh’mae were all Assumed to be 
True, but were aU 

Fictitious: 

(A) In GeneraL—After it was discovered that the New Action could be utilized by the freeholders through the use 
of the Entry, Lease and Ouster, along about the year 1640, or shortly after the close of Queen Elizabeth’s Reign 
(1558—1603), it finally became clear that it was a useless formality to make an actual Entry, Lease and Ouster, so 
the practice grew up that these steps might be eliminated by merely alleging a Fictitious Entry, Lease, and Ouster by 
the Casual Ejector, This procedure was made workable by the fact that the Courts, eager to escape from the old Real 
Actions, overlooked the falsehood involved. As previously observed, the Casual Ejector did not defend, so that 
Judgment was given in favor of the Fictitious Lessee and plaintiff, who promptly sued out a Writ of Execution, 
under which the lessee was placed in possession, the actual tenant, Z, being dispossessed by the Sheriff. 


(B) The Common Consent Rula—lIt is not difficult to imagine what Z, the Actual Tenant, who up to now had 
heard nothing of this suit, said when thus confronted with the Execution. And what he and other Z’s in a similar 
position said was expressed in such loud, raucous and determined tones that the Courts decided to do something 
about it What they did was to make a Rule of Court that no Execution should issue where the Ejector was a stranger, 
or not the Actual Tenant, until the adverse actual occupant— the Actual Tenant, Z—was notified of the pendency 
of the action, and offered an opportunity, if he so desired, to appear and defend the action in place of the Casual 
Ejector. This end was accomplished through the device of a note or letter from the Casual Ejector to the Actual 
Tenant, notifying him that he had been sued, and that if he desired to defend, he should appear and ask to be

substituted as the defendant in place of the Casual Ejector. 


Page 245 of 735 


And it was at this moment, and as a sort of condition precedent to such substitution of the Actual Tenant, that the 
Actual Tenant was advised by the Court that he might be permitted to defend, if he agreed to enter into the 
Common Consent Rule, which involved an admission of the Entry, Lease and 
Ouster, thus leaving the only remaining issue one of title, which was the objective of the fiction and which thus 
made available to the owner of a freehold estate a remedy which in legal theory was available only to the holder of a 
non-freehold estate. Now, the lineup of the parties reads as follows: A ex dem. (lessee) of L v. Z, the Actual Tenant. 
The whole process is set forth in the chart which appears below:

FROM the Chart as set forth above the student may derive an understanding of how 
take advantage of a remedy which, in legal Theory, was available only to the holder of a non-freehold estate, as 
previously explained. 
He may also clearly see the meaning of the phrase “the lessor of the plaintiff,” so often

met with in the cases on property. Thus, a glance at the Chart will reveal that after the Fiction in Ejectment had been 
invoked, the lineup of the parties stood as follows: A, cx dent. L v. Z. Obviously, under this setup, the lessor of the 
nominal plaintiff, A, is L, the landlord, who, in reality, is the true plaintiff. 


In the third place, from the Chart the student may understand the basis of the Common Law rule that a Judgment 


in one Action of Ejectment was never a Bar to recovery in another Action. In the case of Caperton v. Schmidt,” 
the rule has been explained by Sawyer, 3., who declared: “But we have seen, that the nile in all cases requires that 


Page 246 of 735 


the matter tried must be directly, and not merely collaterally in issue, in order that the judgment shall be a Bar. And 
in an Action of Ejeetment at Common Law the title is not directly in issue; hence the Judgment under the rule was 
not a bar, nor could the determination of the title be used as a matter of estoppel.” 


The Classification of Ejectment 

THE Action of Ejectment has been variously classified. While it was developed as and became a substitute for the 
Ancient Real Actions, it has never assumed the character of a Real Action. It has sometimes been classified as a 
Mixed Action, but it does not possess the characteristics of the Common- 

Law Mixed Action, except the single circumstance that it made it possible for the plaintiff to regain possession of his 
land. This characteristic, as Professor Keigwin aptly observes was “an adventitious and almost accidental incident of 
the action, tacked on long after the invention of Ejectment and resulting from extrinsic causes and an originally 
unforeseen development.” 14 It is no

ed. Rochester, 1934). 


surprise, therefore, that most modem authorities declare that Ejectment is still a Personal Action.” 


Ejeetment Asserts Right of Possession ol’ LaS 

SINCE the abolition of the Ancient Real Actions, Ejectment has become the chief means of trying Title to lands 
or tenements and recovering possession thereof. It is the name now applied to the action by which the plaintiff 
asserts his right to possession of land, resulting either from absolute ownership or some lesser proprietary right, 
whereby he is entitled to enter into immediate possession of some interest in land. The action 
is, therefore, limited by definition to the recovery of corporeal real property; 16 but not things which are not tangible real 
property.’! Ejectment may be brought to recover 
lands or things attached to the land so as to partake of the nature of realty, such as timber, growing crops and the 
like. Personal property and in general incorporeal hereditaments may not be recovered, as the action is limited to 
property the possession of which may be delivered by the sheriff. ° 


For What Property Will Ejectment Lie to Recover? 
IN consequence, Ejectment will only lie for the recovery of possession of real property, as for lands, or buildings

The defendant may hold the land without any Title thereto, as his mere possession gives him a right to resist 


Ejectment until some one asserts and shows a better right to the property. Thus, by the weight of authority, prior 
possession, without any further Title, is sufficient as against a mere intruder; so that if a stranger, who has no 
Color of Title, should evict a person who has been in quiet possession, but who has no strict Legal Title, the latter may 
maintain Ejectmerit against him."

The plaintiff need not, however, prove a Perfect Title in himself; he need only show a Title which, as against the 
defendant, is a better Title. When, therefore, it is possible for the plaintiff to show that he was in possession and that 
the defendant ejected him by a mere trespass, the prior possession of the plaintiff is superior to that of the defendant; 
and upon a showing to that effect, he may recover upon his better but Imperfect Title.” 

As Ejeetment was strictly a legal action, at Common Law, it required a Legal Title to 
maintain or to defeat it. The plaintiff must, therefore, have a legal right to possession. The Legal Title, so far as it 
relates to the right of possession, must prevail in Ejectment. Hence, one who has such a Title will win as against one 
who has a mere beneficial or equitable interest, enforceable in the Courts of Equity. Such an interest, unac- 
companied by the Legal Title, will not suffice to support or defeat the action.”

Sec. 106 ACTION OF EJECTMENT 
236 
OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Ch. 10 
If there has been no Ouster, or the defendant is not thus in possession when the action commenced, the action 
must fail. Trespass, not Ejectment, would be the proper remedy in such case. 


EJECTMENT.—.-DISTINGUJSIED FROM AND CONCURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 

107. Strictly speaking, Ejectment is to be distinguished from the Writs of Right to Try Title among the old Real 
Actions, and from Trespass to Try Title; and it was concurrent with trespass in its early stages of development and 
with the Writ of Entry. 


THE Action of EjeCtment, in theory, was designed to try the right of possession, and is to be distinguished from 
the Writs of Right, which, in legal theory, were designed to try Property Rights or Title. These Ancient Real 
Actions, however, were finally abolished, and Ejectrnent was substituted in lieu thereof, as it was found as a 
practicable matter that you could not Try Title without trying the Right to Possession. The Action is also to be 
distinguished from Trespass to Try Title, which prevailed in a few Southern States, and which, in those states, was 
a substitute for Ejectment, but, unlike Ejectment, could be maintained on an Equitable Title. Ejectment was, of 
course, concurrent with Trespass, in its early stages of development, as it grew out of Trespass. And, in the 
sense that it lay wherever the plaintiff had a Right of Entry, it was also concurrent with the Writ of Entry.

FoRM OF COMMON CONSENT RULE 
IN EJECTMEN’T 


Hilary Term, the twenty-ninth year of King George the Second. 

iT is ordered by the court, by the assent of both parties, and their attornies, that George Saunders, 
gentleman, may be made defendant in the place of the now defendant William Stiles, and shall 
immediately appear to the plaintiff’s action, and shall receive a declaration in a plea of trespass and ejectment of the 
tenements in question, and shall immediately plead thereto, not guilty: and, upon the trial of the issue, shall confess 
lease, entry, and ouster, and insist upon his title only. And if, upon trial of the issue, the said George 
Saunders do not confess lease, entry, and ouster, and by reason thereof the plaintiff cannot prosecute his writ, 
then the taxation of costs upon such non-pros, shall cease, and the said George Saunders shall pay such costs 
to the plaintiff, as by the court of our lord the kind here shall be taxed and adjudged for such his default in 
non-performance of this rule; and judgment shall be entered against the said William Stiles, now the casual 
ejector, by default. And it is further ordered, that, if upon trial of the said issue a verdict shall be given for the 
defendant, or if the plaintiff shall not prosecute his writ, upon any other cause than for the not confessing 
lease, entry and ouster, as aforesaid, then the lessor of the plaintiff shall pay costs, if the plaintiff himself doth 
not pay them.

DECLARATION IN EJECTMENT—ESSEN. 
TIAL ALLEGATIONS: (1) INGENERAL 
109, The Essential Allegations in the Declaration in Ejectment are: 
(I) The Title of the plaintiff to certain Land 
(ID The wrongful Ouster or Disposses 
sion 


Page 253 of 735 


(III) The Damages 

The Fiction by which Ejectment was extended from a remedy for Non-Freehold Tenants to Freeholders has 
in general been abolished. Today, the suit is usually brought by the real plaintiff against a defendant who is the 
Actual Occupant. 

All Declarations in Ejectment must describe the premises demanded with certainty and precision. 


THE fictions by which the Action of Ejectment was extended from a remedy for a lessee to all claimants, involved 
alleging in the declaration: (1) A Lease from the real plaintiff to the nominal plaintiff, John Doe; 

(2) The Entry by the nominal plaintiff wider the Lease; and (3) The Ouster of the nominal plaintiff by the nominal 
defendant (the Casual Ejector, Richard Roe) during the term of the lease. This childish mummery is now generally 
discarded. 


Description of Premises 

AS the recovery of a specific tract or 
tracts of land is the main object of this action, the Declaration must describe the premises demanded with certainty 
and precision, so as to clearly identify them, not only in order that it may be seen that the property demanded is 
the same as that with reference 
to which evidence is introduced, but also in 
order that possession may be delivered to the plaintiff or demandant if he succeeds in establishing his right.”

DECLARATION IN EJECTMENT—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (2) THE PLAINTIFF’S RIGHT, 
TITLE, INTEREST OR POSSESSION 
110. The Declaration in Ejectment must describe the premises in question, and state the Title. It should 


also allege a Right of Entry in the plaintiff at the time the action is brought. 


The Plaintiff s Right 

AS we have shown above, the plaintiff, to maintain Ejectment, must have a Legal Right to possession at the time 
the action is commenced, though prior peaceable possession, without further Title, may be sufficient as 
against a mere intruder or trespasser, The Declaration must, of course, show such a Title and Right, or it will 
fail to state a good cause of action. It is sufficient under some statutory forms to allege that plaintiff was owner 
and possessed of the premises sued for, describing them as in a deed of conveyance.” 


DECLARATION IN EJECTMENT—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (3) THE WRONG- 
Flit OUSTER OR DISPOSSESSION 
111. The Declaration should state an Ouster or Dispossession of the plaintiff, in fact or in law, and an 
actual, adverse possession by the defendant. 


THE Action of Ejectment, as we have seen, is only proper where there has been

what amounts, in point of fact or in point of law, to an ouster or dispossession of the person having the Right 
of Entry upon the premises in question. As we have also seen, the 

Ouster need not be by an actual turning out of the plaintiff. It may be, for instance, merely a holding over by a 
tenant after the expiration of his term. It is also generally essential that the defendant shall be in actual possession 
when suit is brought, and that such possession shall be adverse. These requirements may not exist in all the states, 
for the scope of this action has been enlarged in some of them by statute, The Declaration must, in all cases, show 
such an Ouster or Dispossession, and such adverse possession or claim, as is necessary in the particular jurisdiction 
to a maintenance of the action.” 


DECLARATION IN EJECTMENT—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (4) THE DAMAGES 


112. The Declaration should also state the Damages caused by the dispossession of the plaintiff, though their 
recovery is not the main object of the Action. They are usually, at Common Law, Nominal only. If the Action, 
as in some states, includes the recovery of Mesne Profits, the Damages must also include such profits, and should be 
laid high enough to cover both the Full Amount of Such Profits and the Damages for the injury- 


WHILE at Common Law the Damages recoverable hi this action were, and in some states still are, only those 
caused by the dispossession or ouster, and the amount would, therefore, be generally only a nominal sum, in most the 
plaintiff is also allowed to recover the Mesne Profits, or those which the defendant has received during his 
adverse possession; 3s and in such case the Damages al

leged must include a sum sufficient to cover these.*° At Common Law, and when the above privilege is not 
allowed, as the right of possession only is the subject of controversy, the Damages in Ejectment are merely 
nominal, and a nominal amount only need be stated.*° 


THE JUDGMENT IN EJECTMENT 
113. At Common Law a Judgment in an Action of Ejectment was never a Bar to another 


action, as the real plaintiff, the Landlord, a!though mentioned in the title of the action, was not, in reality, a party to the 
action, and hence was not bound thereby. With the abohilion of the Fiction in Ejectment, the action is now 
directed against the Actual Occupant, as opposed to the Fictitious Lessee, hence a Judgment is now binding 
and may be pleaded under the doctrine of res judicata. 


AS explained earlier, because the landlord, who was mentioned in the Title of a case in 
Ejeetment, was not in reality a party to the action, the Judgment in Ejectment at Common Law was not 
conclusive, and hence could not be invoked under the doctrine of res judicata. The judgment, for the same 
reason, Was not even conclusive as between the same parties or as to the same land, as the defeated landlord, not 
being a party to the action, was free to seek two new collaborators, and thus start litigation all over again. 
This situation created so much dissatisfaction that in the early part of the Eighteenth Century, after the plaintiff 
had been defeated in several

suits, the Court of Chancery intervened to enjoin the plaintiff from prosecuting further actions. This same early 
practice was sometimes the cause of what was known as Equitable Bills of Peace.” Under modem statutes 
abolishing the Fiction in Ejeetment, the action is now directed in the names of the actual parties, hence the Judgment 
carries the same conclusiveness and finality as any other Judgment and, of course, may be pleaded under the 
doctrine of rca judicata.” 


DECLARATION IN TRESPASS FOR MESNE 
PROFITS—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: 
(1) IN GENERAL 
114. In the Declaration in Trespass for Mesne Profits, the Essential Allegations are: 
(D The Tithe of the Plaintiff 
(ID The Ouster or Ejectment 
(ID The Damages 


EVERY wrongful Ejectment includes a Trespass, as Ejectment was created by extending the Action of Trespass 
to protect the interests of the non-freeholders or tenants. It follows, therefore, that one who recovers land from 
which he has been ousted is not 
only entitled to recover Damages for the 
original act of dispossession, but he is also entitled to recover Damages for the time the disseisor continued in 
occupation of the premises and for the wrongful withholding thereof. This act of withholding was, however, not a 
Trespass, though tortious. As Saimond remarks: “To remain wrongfully in possession of land is not, as we have 
seen, a trespass, although the act of first entering upon the land was a trespass.” - In consequence, the profits 
realized from the land by the wrongdoer during the period of wrongful retention of the property, were not recover-

able in the Action of Ejectment; only Damages for the wrongful Ouster, the amount being merely nominal, 
and not sufficient to compensate the plaintiff for the long period 
of occupation by the wrongdoer, extending 
from the date of the original disseisin until the time of recovery of possession. In order to place himself in a 
legal position to recover the profits acquired by the wrongdoer, the plaintiff was required to regain possession by a 
lawful Re-Entry, or by a Judgment in the Action of Ejectment. Having recovered possession, the owner was, by 
a Legal Fiction, presumed” to have been in possession throughout the intervening period. Upon this presumed 
possession, the plaintiff may then bring an Action f or Mesne Profits against the person who was the defendant 
in the Action of Ejectment. In this action, the wrongful occupation may be alleged as a continuing Trespass which 
entitles the owner, now restored to possession, to all the profits made during the period of his ouster. These 
profits included crops, rents, or other assets taken from the land during the period of disseisin, as well as other 
Damages due for injury to the property.~

Page 256 of 735 


PROFITS—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: 
(2) THE PLAINTIFFS RIGHT, TITLE, INTEREST OR POSSESSION 


115. The Declaration in Trespass for Mesne Profits must describe the premises from which the profits 
arose, and the title of the plaintiff thereto, as well as the value of the profits themselves, and their receipt by the 
defendant. 


IT is obvious from the nature of this aE-’ tion that the plaintiff must expressly state and describe the 
different parcels of land

(1855). 


from which the profits arose,“ as the defendant might otherwise compel him to make what is called a New 
Assignment, or restatement of the grounds of his action, by pleading “iiberwrt tenementum” or the common bar. 
As it is a separate action from the prior Action of Ejectment, the plaintiff’s title to the premises should also 
appear, as ‘cvell as the value of the Mesne Profits accrued, and their receipt by the defendant during the period of 
the Ejectment. All these facts are stated in a general and summary manner, as in other Forms of Trespass, save that 
the 

description of the premises must be such as to identify them, and the value of the Mesne Profits which the 
defendant is alleged to have received must be correctly alleged.” 

The pleader will here avoid confusion by noting that while this action may be between those only who were 
parties to the prior Action of Ejectn’.ent, and while in such cases the Judgment in that Action will be Conclusive 
Proof of the plaintiff's Possessory Title, and of the Entry and Possession of the defendant,~ the suit may 
also be for the recovery of Mesne Profits for an occupancy antecedent to the time for which the plaintiff's Title has 
been actually established, or the Action may be brought against a precedent occupier, in which cases the Record 
would not be admissible, and the plaintiff would be compelled to prove his Title as in any action.” The action, 
therefore, so far as the pleadings are concerned, must be separate and independent, as if no prior adjudication 
had been made.

PROFITS—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: 
(3) THE OUSTER OR EJECTMENT 


116. The Declaration must also state the Entry and Ouster or Ejectment by the defendant, and the time 
during which the latter continued. 


FOR the same reasons as those above given regarding the particularity of statement necessary in showing 
the plaintiff’s right, the Declaration must also contain a Formal Allegation that at a certain time the defendant 


Page 257 of 735 


wrongfully entered upon the premises in question, and ejected the plaintiff therefrom, and the length of time such 
dispossession continued; so and this statement of the injury should also include an Allegation of Waste or other 
injury to the property committed by the defendant during that period, as the plaintiff will be allowed to include such 
Damage in his recovery.

(4) THE DAMAGES 
117- The Declaration must also state the Damages resulting from the wrongful dispossession, which, in this 
Action, are generally the value of the Mesne Profits received by the defendant. 


WE have before seen that the Damages in 
the Common-Law Action of Ejectment are Nominal, only. In this Action for Mesne Profits, the recovery of 
the profits themselves, or rather their value, is the object of the action, and not the enforcement of the 
possessory right. The Damages to be stated, therefore, are the value of such profits during the period of 
dispossession; -‘ but the plaintiff may add to this, if specially alleged as part of his claim, the Damage resulting 
from any injury done to the premises in con

sequence of any misconduct of the defendant.” And this case is also an instance within the general rules that the 
recovery cannot exceed the Damages laid. 


STATUS OF EJECTMENT AND TRESPASS FOR MESNE PROFITS UNDER MODERN CODES,

118. Under certain Modem Codes and Practice Acts the Plaintiff may recover mesne profits in his action to 
recover possession of real property, thereby in effect permitting a combination of what at the Common Law 
were the separate actions of Ejectment and Trespass for mesne profits. 


Ejeetment 

(I) In England.—In the form and scope, as outlined above, the Action of Ejectment continued down to modern 
times, superseding practically all the Ancient Real Actions known to the Common Law. By the Statute of 3 & 4 
Wm. IV, c. 27, § 36 (1833), the Real Actions were abolished, Ejectment, under Section 36 being one of Four 
Actions excepted. The Statute provided that no descent cast, discontinuance, or warranty shall hereafter defeat 
any Right of Entry or Action for the recovery of any lands, and this enactment, in effect, converted all Titles into 
Possessory Titles, and thus made the remedy by Ejectment of universal application, and, in this Form, it remained 
unchanged until 1852.

Common Law Action of Ejectment, as developed by the Courts, having escaped the abolishing effects of 3 & 4 
Was. IV, c 27 (1833), underwent material change, which had the effect of abolishing the fictitious proceeding in 
Ejectment and of reforming and simplifying its procedure. Pleadings of all kinds were abolished and thereafter 
the action was commenced by a Judicial Writ directed to the person in possession and to all persons entitled to 
defend the possession of the property claimed and described in the Writ, commanding them to appear and defend 
the possession of the property sued for, or such part thereof as they may deem fif, and notifying them that in 
default of appearance they would be turned out of possession. If the defendants failed to appear, or appeared for 
the purpose of defending only a part of the property, the plaintiff was entitled to a Judgment of Recovery of all or 
part of the land sued for, as the case might be. As appearance itself constituted a Defense to the Writ, the Court 
then made up an issue between the one who 
claimed possession in the Writ and the parties appearing to defend their possession. Such issue, thus formulated, was 
then fried according to the general principles which the Common Law had developed for the governing of the 
former Action of Ejectrnent. It was assumed that these three Reforming Acts authorized the use of 
Equitable Defenses, but the Courts in construing them held that such Defenses were not available, as the 
Pleadings had been abolished. 


(B) The Supreme Court of Judicature Act of 1873,~°—In this Form the Action continued down to the Supreme 
Court of Judicature Act of 1873. Under this Act the Superior Courts of Law and the Courts of Chancery 
were consolidated into the High Court of Justice, with five divisions, and thereafter the Action of Ejectnient, 
and all other actions, were commenced by a Judicial Writ of Summons, upon which the plaintiff endorsed 

a Statement of his Calm, together with the relief asked for, to which the defendant made a Statement of his 
Defense. The pleadings were governed by Rules of Court under General Orders issued in 1833. By Rule 21 un- 
der Order XXI, a defendant in possession was excused from pleading his Title unless his Defense depended upon a.n 
equitable estate or right, or unless he asked for relief on equitable grounds. Under the influence and effect of the 
foregoing statutory changes, extending from 1833 until now, in England, Ejectment has lost its name and many of 
its distinctive features, but even today, the principles underlying the Action of Ejectment still govern where 
an Action is brought for the recovery of land. 


(ID In the United States.—The Action of Ejectment, as developed at Common Law, and prior to the 
modem statutory changes in England, was generally adopted in the Several States of the United States. Some idea 
as to the extent of its acceptance can be seen in Tyler’s excellent work on Ejectment,” the 
particulars of which cannot be included here, In most states the Fictitious Proceeding in 
Ejectment has been wholly abolished, and such statutes usually provide that the action shall be brought in 
the name of the Real Claimant out of possession against the Ac-thai Tenant or occupant of the land. With the old 
Fictitious Allegations swept away, the Action has been converted into a simple and direct remedy for the 
assertion of Title to real property held adversely, and for the recovery of its possession. Thus, for example, in 
the State of Illinois, the Action of Ejectment was expressly retained by the Statute,M but Section 8 of the same 
statute provided that “The use of fictitious names of

Ejectment by a Casual or Nominal Ejector, are hereby abolished.” And the same was true in Michigan and other 
59 
states. 


In those states where a Statutory Form of Ejectment was adopted, as in Illinois, Michigan and New York, 
while the name was retained, the Mode of Procedure, and the circumstances under which it would lie, 
were prescribed.” It still remains true, however, that the rules and principles which for centunes were 
applicable to and developed by the old Common Law Action of Ejectment are, for most part, equally 
applicable to its Modem Statutory Counterpart, which, alter all, is merely an evolutionary development of 
its ancestor. 


The situation was modified in most of the 
Code States, in most of which it was provided that a defendant might Plead as many Several Defenses as he had, 
whether Consistent or Inconsistent, or whether denominated Legal or Equitable. In such states a defendant may offer 
Proof of an Equitable Title against a Legal Title shown by a plaintiff in an Action of Ejectment. And the same 
provision also prevails even in some states which failed to adopt the Code Form of Procedure.

Trespass for Mesne Profits 

ORIGINALLY, the Action of Ejectment was an action for the recovery of Damages, not for recovery of the 
premises, and at that time the Mesne Profits were the measure of the Damages. But when it became established 
that the premises was recovered in 
an Action of Ejectment, the Damages in the action were limited to Nominal Damages. And this was the 
development which created the necessity of what came to be known as the Action of Trespass for Mesne Profits.°! 
In some states this Form of Action is still the proper remedy. In certain states, however, by statute, the plaintiff was 
required to recover for Mesne Profits in the original action to recover the premises,” whereas, in others, the 
provision was not mandatory.°? An example of this type of statute, changing the Common Law Rule, may be 
found in Section 601 of the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, 1968, which contains the 
following provisions: “In an action to recover the possession of real property, the plaintiff may recover damages 
for withholding the property, including the rents and profits or the value of the use and occupation of the 
property for a term not exceeding six years; but the damages shall not include the value of the use of any 
improvements made by the defendant or those under whom he claims.”

of the chattel itself, or its value, with Damages for its detention. To maintain the action— 

(I) The chattel must be specific and capable of identification; 
(ID The plaintiff must have either a General or Special Property hi the chattel, or the Right to Immediate 
Possession;

taking or detaining goods, or in Assumpsit for not delivering them, Damages only, and not the Specific 
Property, can be recovered. It seems that the action was originally deemed an action cx con tractu, but now 
the wrongful detention of the goods is considered the Gist of the Action. The action lies without regard to 
any bailment or contract, and even though the defendant may have 
wrongfully obtained possession in the first instance; and it is therefore more properly classed with Actions cx 
delicto, or with Proprietary Actions.’

The action of Detinue is, as we have seen, proprietary in character, and there has been some difficulty as to whether it should be classified as an

Ca’ eontraotu or sa’ deticto form of action. 


The right to join debt with detinue, I Saunders, The Law of Pleading and Evidence in Civil Actions, Detinue, 502 [434) (Philadelphia 1831), and 
to sue in detinue for not delivering the goods in pursuance of the terms of a bailment to the defendant, it is argued, seem to afford ground for 
considering it rather as a contract than as a tort action. 


On the other hand, since dctinne lies, although the defendant wrongfully became the possessor thereof (of goods), in the first instance, without 
relation to any contract, it has recently been considered as a tort, The gist of the action is the wrongful detainer. and not the breach of the 
contract. Gledstane v. Hewitt, 1 Cromp~ & 1 565, 148 Eng.Rep. 1548 (1831); Wilkinson v. Verity, LIT. C OP. 206 (1871); Bryant v. Herbert,

McKelvry, in his short work on Principles of Common-Law Pleading, e. II, $ 18, 11 (New York 1804). in discussing the problem of the proper 
classification of dctinue, declares: “In detinue this feature is not quite so apparent; in fact, the tendency has been to class the action with that of 
Trover. and to treat the detaining in the former action as a tortious act similar to the converting In the latter. 


The Action of Detinue was for a long period the proper remedy of the bailor and 


special or acquired right. For, while it is true that one person has the natural right not to have his property interfered with by another, and that 
wrongful detention is an Interference which would be a violation of this right, yet, viewed in this light, the wrongful act furnishes ground for 
an action of Trover, and not Detinuc. [Kettle v. Bromsall, Willes 120, 125 Eng.Rep. 1087 (1738), where the distinction is noticed, and it is 
held that Trover and Detinue cannot be joined.] 


“The same act may furnish grounds for an action of Detinue, but not unless it is viewed in another light, namely, as a detention of property which 
the defendant is under an obligation to deliver to the plaintiff, or in other words, a failure to perform a special obligation, a violation of a 
special right, which the plaintiff has acquired not by reason of his simple ownership of the property, hut by reason of the fact that there is a 
special relation between himself and the defendant, such as a bailment, and that owning or having the general right to the property which is 
lawfully in defendants possession, he has asserted that right in such a wa3-—a g., by demand—as to acquire a special right to the immediate 
possession of the property, and to put upon the defendant a special obligation to deliver it to him. It has already been seen that the judgment in 
the action of Detinue is for the recovery of the property or its value in the alternative. The special obligation to deliver the property, similar to 
an obligation based on a promise and arising because of the special relation of the parties, is thus recognized and enforced. In fact, the action 
of Detinue has been brought upon a contract to deliver a specific chattel. [Fitaherbert, Natura Breviuni, p. 138]. It seems clear, therefore, 
tbat Detinue is properly classed with the actions of Debt, Covenant, and Assumpsit. [These forms of action are generally distinguished by 
the term actions cr oontroctr’, as distinguished from the actions known as Ca delictu, on the theory that the former are brought upon contract 
and the latter for a tort or wrong. The terms, however, are not strictly applicable, as the idea of contract in its usually understood sense does not 
necessarily enter into the action of Debt or that of Detinue, both of said actions many times being founded upon obligations arising from 
special relations between the parties other than contractual. Further, to say tbat an action is for a wrong, does not distinguish it, as every action 
is for a wrong. The writer submits that the true basis of the distinction which undoubtedly does exist, is that the one class of actions is for 
wrongs which are violations of original or natural rights,—rights which belong to one person as ggainst all others; while the other class Is for 
wrongs which are yb- 

“Tt is conceived that the true theory of the action of 
detinue is that the detention is the violation of a

was chiefly used in the field of bailment. When an owner bails or delivers a thing to another for any purpose, 
he has an action against the baflee for the return of the goods; but whether the action was based upon ownership or 
upon contract was a distinc— tion not clearly drawn or perceived. Gradually the claim for a Specific Chattel was 
distinguished from a Debt or Claim for a Certain Quantity of Money, or of Corn or the Like. Roughly, this 
distinction may seem to correspond with that between contractual and proprietary rights. 


Detinue in its modern form (theory) has come to be what we may term a Proprietary Action, a remedy to enforce a 
right of prop— erty. It carries into effect the right to the immediate possession of a particular thing. The 
restitution of the goods themselves wrongfully withheld makes it necessary, in this action of Detinue, to ascertain 
the thing detained, in such manner that it may be specifically known and recovered. Therefore it cannot be brought 
for money, corn, or the like; for that cannot be known from other money or corn, unless it be in a bag or sack, for 


then it may be distinguishably marked, and unless the property is specified the duty enforced would be a mere 
debt or obligation. 


latloas of special or acquired rights,—riglits which one person has against some other particular person or persons who have come into some 
special relation with him.)” 


Page 262 of 735 


It was formerly urged by such a distinguished scholar as Dean Ames, that detinue originated out of the contract of bailment under which the 
defendant bailee was forced to deliver up specific chattels. Thereafter, the scope of the action was extended, so that it ceased to be based on a 
personal obligutboa and became based on a property right and wrongful detention. The view of Dean Ames has been brought In serious 
question by Professor Fi’ foot, In his excellent recent work on The History and sources of the Common Law, c. 2, Detinue, 24-’ 43 (London 
1949). 


See, also, on this problem, Whiteliead v. Harrison, 6 Q.E. (N.S.) 422, 115 Eng.Eep. 162 (1844); Wlard v. Semken, 2 App.D.O. 424 (1893), 

There was a most serious imperfection in the remedy of Detinue, even where it existed. Its Judgment was 
Conditional—that the plaintiff should recover from the defendant the said goods, or (if they cannot be had) 
their Value and the Damages for detaining them. This left to the defendant the choice between delivering up the 
thing and paying a sum of money, and if he would do neither the one nor the other, then goods of his were 
seized and sold, and the plaintiff in the end had to take money instead of the thing that he demanded.* 


In modern times this defect has been cured, so that a plaintiff who recovers in Detinue gets a Judgment for the 
specific delivery of the chattel detained. The action may now be used concurrently with Replevin, Trover, and 
Trespass de bonis aspo?’tatis, in all cases of the wrongful detention of chattels, regardless of whether the 
defendant originally acquired possession lawfully by bailment or by theft. 


For What Property 

DETINUE lies for the recovery of a Specific Chattel only, and not for the recovery 
of fixtures, or other real property.° The goods for which it is brought must be distinguishable from other property, 
and their identity ascertainable by some certain means.° It lies to recover any chattel that is

But where property which was attached to the realty so as to become a part of it, has been removed, and where timber, crops or minerals 


have been severed, thus acqairing the character of personal property, detinue will lie. Cooper v. Watson, 73 Ala. 252 (1882); Adler v.

so identified that it may be recovered in specie.’ The chattel, of course, must be in existence. The action cannot be 
maintained in case of its destruction before suit is brought.” But if the chattel is destroyed after suit is commenced 
defendant will not be relieved from liability.’ 


DETINUE—IJISTINGIJISHED FROM AND 
CONCURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 
120. Once Detinue was differentiated from Debt, it was distinguishable from that action as being for the recovery of 
specific chattels as contrasted to money; it was distinguished from Replevin originally as being available only where 
the defendant acquired possession lawfully, whereas in Replevin the defendant obtained possession wrongfully; it differed 
also in respect to the time when possession or its equivalent was to be restored to the plaintiff. In its final state of 
development Detinue became to a considerable extent a concurrent remedy with the Actions of Trespass de bonis 
asportatis, Replevin and Trover.

at the end of thirty days, and also loaned to 
B five hundred dollars to be repaid in thirty days, and at the end of the period, if B, upon demand, refused to 
deliver up the horse or to repay the money, Debt, not Detinue, lay to recover the money, as both possession and 
title passed to the bailee, whereas Detinue, not Debt, lay to recover the horse, as only possession, not Title, 
was transferred to B 
by the loan.” Detinue therefore differed 
from Debt in that it was for the recovery of specific chattels, but not chattels in the form of money, which, 
because of its negotiable character, was treated as creating a debt, Originally Detinue was distinguished from 
Replevin in that it lay only for goods lawfully obtained, whereas Replevin lay only where the goods were 
unlawfully taken;” uitimately, however, Detinue also became available where the taking was tortious. The two 
actions were and are still distinguishable in that in Replevin the plaintiff is restored to the possession prior to 
the determination of the matter of right between the parties, whereas in Detinue the plaintiff does not recover his 
property until the matter of right between the parties has been determined by a Final Judgment in the Action, and not 
even then if the defendant prefers to keep the chattel and pay its assessed value.’” In Trover, as contrasted with 
Detinue, the Judgment was for the recovery of Money Damages for the wrongful act of conversion, whereas, in 
Detinue, the Primary Object of the Action was to recover Specific

Chattels, although, as just observed, the defendant was permitted to exercise an option of surrendering the goods or 
paying the Assessed Damages.” And so in Trespass do bonis asportatis, unlike Detinue, the action 
is for the recovery of Money Damages as 
compensation to the plaintiff for the infringement to the right of possession of his property, the value of the 
property being considered as an important element in the measurement of Damages. Detinue had become, in its 
final stage of development, to a considerable extent a concurrent remedy with the actions of Trespass do bonis 
asportatis and Trover. 

FORMS OF DECLARATION AND JUDGMENT IN IJETINUE 

121. The Forms under the Action of Detinue include not only the Declaration, but also a Form of a Judgment. The 
latter is included in order to show that the Judgment in Detinue, contrary to Judgments in the other Actions, 
was Conditional or in the Alternative, that is, for the Specific Chattels sued for, or if they were not available, 
their Value plus Damages for the wrongful detention.

13. “The reason of this may perhaps be found partly in the perishable character of medieval movables, and the consequent feeling that the 
court could not accept the task of restoring them to their owners, and partly in the idea that all things had a ‘legal price’ which, if the plaintiff

14. One of the major defects in the Action of Detinue consisted of the fact that its judgment was conditlonal or in the alternative. Thus, it provided 
that the plaintiff should recover of the defendant the specific chattels sued for, or if they were not available, their value plus damages 
for the wrongful detention, See Kirkland v. Fllcher, 174 Ala. 170, 57 So, 48 (1911). This defect was remedied by Section 
78 of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1854, which empowered a court or judge, upon applica 

attorney, complains of Augustus White (the defendant in this suit), who has been summoned to answer the said 
plaintiff in an action of Detinue. For that whereas the said plaintiff heretofore and before the commencement of this 
suit, to wit, on the 12th day of February, in the year of our Lord 1845, had delivered to the said defendant 
certain goods and chattels, to wit, twenty pipes of wine of the said plaintiff, of great value, to wit of the 
value of £2,000, to be redelivered by the said defendant to the said plaintiff when the said defendant should 
be thereunto afterwards requested: yet the said defendant, although he was afterwards, to wit, on the first day 
of March, in the year aforesaid, requested by the said plaintiff so to do, hath not as yet delivered the said goods 
and chattels, or any of them, or any part thereof, to the said plaintiff, but so to do hath hitherto wholly refused, 
and still refuses, and still unjustly detains the same from the said plaintiff, to the damage of the said plaintiff of 
£800, and thereupon he brings his suit,~

JUDGMENT IN DETINUE’> 


Common 
THEREFORE it is considered that the plaintiff do recover against the defendant the said goods and chattels (or 
“deeds and paper” etc. or enumerating them, if enumerated in the postea,) or the said sum of 


tion of the plaintiff, to order the return of the specific chattel in question, thus depriving the defend’ ant of his option of retaining the chattel 
upon payment of the value assessed, Cf. Tierney v. Corbett, 2 Mackey S.C.D.C. 264 (1883).

RIGHT, TITLE, INTEREST OF POSSES 
SION: 

123. The Declaration must describe the thing detained sufficiently for purposes of ident’ tfication and assert 
the plaintiff’s Title and Right of Possession. 


The plaintiff’s Right may arise from General Ownership, or some Special Interest, or as against a 
wrongdoer, from Bare Possession. 
Description of the Property 

AS the Action of Detinue lies only to recover specific chattels, known and distinguished from all others, more 
Certainty is required in the Declaration in their description than in Trespass or Trover; and it must be such as to 
particularly identify them as the goods in question.’® This particularity, however, need not extend to every 
matter of 
detail, and need only include enough to identify them, either as individual articles or as a number of things 
belonging to a particular class, according to the circumstances of each particular case.” 


There were anciently Two Modes of Counting in Detinue. The plaintiff must say 
either, “I bailed the chattel to you,” or “I lost the goods and you found them” (detinue stir tro-ver). Only in 
times much later did the lawyers say that these phrases about finding (Trover) and bailment, though one of 
them must be used, are not “Traversable,” and that defendant must not deny them, but must deny the wrongful 
detention.’ 


The Plaintiff's Right 
The plaintiff must have either a General or Special Property in the chattels, or he must have a Right to the 
immediate Possession of them.’° That he has this right

addition of 

such Special Damage as the plaintiff may have sustained by the wrongful act of the defendant.” 


STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 

126. An action to recover possession of a chattel, or its value in case delivery cannot be had, may be 
maintained under many Modem Codes and Practice Acts under the same circumstances as an Action of 
Detinue would be maintainable at Common Law. 
IN the California case of Faulkner v. First National Bank of Santa Barbara,”* decided in the year 1900, under 
the statutory provisions concerning the Claim and Delivery of Personal Property, the plaintiff averred that she had 
deposited certain promissory notes as collateral security for a promissory note made to plaintiff by another; 
that she demanded that defendant deliver the notes to her; and that such demand was refused, and that the 
defendant still unlawfully withholds and detains the same, to the damage of the plaintiff in a certain sum. The 
prayer was for the recovery of the notes, or for the sum of forty-six hundred dollars, the value there 
of. After a Verdict and Judgment for the plaintiff, the defendant Appealed, bringing up the Judgment Roll, 
which included a Bill of Exceptions. In affirming the Judgment, McFarland, J., declared: “The Cause of Action in the 
Case at Bar is based on a contract of bailment. The original taking was not unlawful, but the detention was. Now, 
that is just the kind of wrong for which at Common Law the Action of Detinue was

foregoing authorities are eminently just, and are founded on the maxim that no one can take advantage of his 
O~Wi wrong; and they are as applicable now to an action based on a contract of bailment as they were to such an 
action when it had to be brought under the Special Form of Detinue. The usual Judgment in such Action is in the 
Alternative,—that is, that the plaintiff recover possession of the property, or its value in case delivery cannot 
be had; but where it appears that the property cannot be delivered the defendant is in no way prejudiced by a 


Judgment for the value only, and the fact that the Judgment is not in the Alternative is no ground for reversal.”

SCOPE OF TILE ACTION 
127. The Action of Replevin lies, where Specific Personal Property has been wrongfully taken and is 
wrongfully detained, to recover Possession of the Property, together with Damages for its detention. To support 
the Action, it is necessary: 
That the Property shall be Personal; 
That the plaintiff, at the time of the Suit, shall be entitled to the Immediate Possession; 
(III) That (at Common Law) the def end- 
ant shall have wrongfully taken the property (Replevin in the Cepit). But, by Statute, in most States, the Action 
will also Lie where the property is wrongfully detained, though it was lawfully obtained, the first instance (Re- 
plevin in the Detinet); 
(W) That the property shall be wrongfully detained by the defendant at the time of the Suit. 


The Primary and Secondary Objectives of .Replevin 
THE Primary object of Replevin is to enable the plaintiff to obtain possession of the

the goods in specie; but the Action differs from Detinue in that the plaintiff does not have to wait, as in Detinue, 
until the Action is determined, before he can obtain possession. The Secondary object of the Action of 
Replevin is to recover the value of the goods, if for any reason the primary object is defeated, and, in all cases, to recover 
Damages to compensate for the loss of the use of the property while it was detained by the defendant.”

“provisional remedy” of an immediate delivery of the chattel claimed is granted. The Action has to a large extent, 
as we shall see, displaced Detinue, and is now the common remedy to recover possession of a chattel and 


Damages for its wrongful detention, or, in case the thing itself cannot be recovered, Damages for its value 
as well as for its detention. 


The Action, therefore, is not founded merely upon the right to obtain redress for a tort; in Replevin and 


Page 269 of 735 


Detinue, recovery of specific property is the end and aim of the Action. In present-day Law, the Action ef 
Replevin differs from Detinue chiefly by the circumstance that the plaintiff at once secures possession of the 
chattels in dispute. This immediate relief is in the nature of a provisional remedy, granting the plaintiff a 
recovery of the chattels pending the outcome of the action. By this provisional relief the plaintiff really 
accomplishes his object to get possession of his goods; to retain possession, however, he must prosecute his 
action and establish his right. Hence, as a condition of securing this relief in advance and having the Sheriff deliver 
the property—the horse and plough—over to him, he was and is required to give security in the form of a bond 
or undertaking, with sureties, to make out the justice of the claim or return the property to the defendant. 


Does Replevin Lie for AU Unlawfvl Takings? 
AT Common Law Replevin lay only for an unlawful taking of goods. But for several 
hundred years it was employed chiefly for 
only one sort of unlawful taking, that of a wrongful distress.’ The Writ of Replevin, as shown by the Form in 
the Register, mere- 


3- “A distress is the taking of a personal chattel without legal process from the possession of a wrongdoer into the hands of the party aggrieved. 
as a pledge for the redress of an injury, the performance of a duty, or the satisfaction of a dcmand.” Bradby, on Distress, c. VII, Of a 
Distress 

ly alleged an unlawful taking and withholding by the defendant—cepit et injuste detinet, or taken and unjustly 

detained—and there is no suggestion in the early Law which in theory limits Replevin to the field of distress, 

and this view is supported by the fact that the Writ and Pleadings, which is always 


good evidence of the Law, contains no language restricting the action to a wrongful distress." 


As thus developed, an Action of Replevin was the regular way for the plaintiff-tenant to contest the validity, of the 
extra-judicial seizure by which his landlord had taken his goods upon a distress for rent. It consisted in a 
redelivery of the pledge, or thing taken in distress—the horse and plough,—to the owner, upon his giving security 
or bond to try the right of distress and to restore it if the right should be adjudged against him.” 


The theory of the action, as we have observed, was broad enough to cover any Case 
of wrongful taking, and the statement of Blackstone that it was only available in cases of wrongful distress 
was soon shown to be incorrect.° It is now clearly recognized as 


for Fines and Amercements, (1st Am. ed. New 
York, 1808). 
Distress, as here defined, is not to be confused with the remedy of distress as used for the enforcement of Reeognizances or to compel the 
payment of fines and amercements, whore the right to distrain is derived from the agreement of the parties or from custom. Bradhy, on 
Distress, e. VIII, Of a Distress for Fines and Amercements, (1st Am. ed. New York, 1808). 


Apparently, the carliest American ease to extend Replevin to cover a wrongful taking other than a distress, was the New York ease of Pangburn 
v. Pat-ridge, 7 Johns. (N.Y.) 140 (1810),

declared: “The passage to that effect [that ReplevIn lay only for an unlawful distress), in Black-stone’s commentaries [first published in 1767], 
Is not warranted by the books. This action is usually brought to try the legality of a distress; but it will lie for any unlawful taking of a 
chattel. Possession by the plaintiff, and an actual wrongful taking by the defendant, are the only points requisite to support the action; and 
none of the cases, defining the nature of the action, confine it specially to the ease of a chattel, taken under pretence of a distress. The old 
authorities are, that Replevin lies for goods taken tortiously, or by a trespasser; and that the party injured may have Replevin. or Trespass, at 
his election. This is so laid down by Gascoigne, J., in 7 Hen. IV, 25b, and by Danhy, 3., in 2 Ed~v. IV, 16, and by Brian, J., in 6 Hen. VTI, 


Page 270 of 735 


9, and these dicta are cited as good law, in Bro. tit. Replevin. pl. 86, 30, and in Roll,Abr. Tit. Replevin, B. The same rule was admitted by the 
judges in the case of Mason v. Dixon, (Jones Rep. 173) and in Bishop 

v. Montague, Cro.Eliz. 824). Similar language is held, in many of the modern authorities, cited by the plaintiff’s counsel, upon the argument; 
and particularly by Baron Giihert, Baron Comyn, and Lord Redesdale. The opinion of the latter is reported by Schoales and Lefroy, In which 


he lays down the law, with peculiar accuracy and precision. The provisions in our statute (11 Sess. e. 5). 12 R.8. 522, et seq.] apply chiefly to 
cases of illegal distress: 
but there is nothing which confines the remedy to that particular injury. 


“If this question he considered upon principle, It Is proper this Action should be maintainable, wherever there is a tortious taking of a 
chattel out of the possession of another. A great variety of cases might be stated, in which no Damages which a Jury is legally competent 
to give, can compensate for the loss of a particular chattel.” 


“The Nonsuit must, therefore, be set aside, and a New Trial granted, with costs to abide the event of the suit.”

Replevin at Common Law was maintainable in eases where there was an unlawful taking and an unlawful detention of personal 
property, and in such a proceeding there was a seizure under a Writ of Replevin of the subject-matter of the litigation at the beginning of 
the proceeding, while Detinuc at Common Law was maintainable for the recovery of per-

‘The Extension of Replevin to Include Datinue 

In the leading English case, Mennie v. Blake,” and in the leading American case of Harwood v. Smethurst,? on 
Detinue factual situations, that is, where the defendant came into possession of the chattel lawfully, and 
thereafter unlawfully detained it, the plaintiff, in both cases, instead of suing in Detinue, brought Replevin, thus in 
effect requesting the respective Courts to expand the Scope of Replevin so as to include a mere wrongful 
detention, and by this process of Judicial Legislation bring about the absorption of Detinue by Replevin. This, 
both Courts, English and American, refused to do, Chief Justice Whelpley, in Harwood v. Smethurst,’° stating in 
the following striking language: “Although this remedy {Replevin] may be prompt, efficacious, and beneficial, 
and in many cases the only one giving the necessary relief to a party having a right to the possession of 
chattels, I do not feel at liberty, entertaining, as I do, a clear conviction that a tortious taking is necessary by the 
Common Law as the ground of the action, to indulge in judicial legislation for the purpose of enlarging the Scope of 
the Action.” Thus, the Court refused, by judicial action, to extend Replevin to include an unlawful detention, 
and thus bring about a merger of Detinue in Replevin. 


But what the Court refused to do by ,Judicfa~ Legislation in the Mennie and Harwood cases, the Legislature 
of New Jersey did by express enactment, thus finally extending the scope of Replevin to include a lawful taking 
and an unlawful detention, which the Court

had refused to sanction. The end was achieved by a statute which provided “That any unlawful detention of 
goods and chattels from their lawful owner, or the person entitled by law to the possession of the same, shall 
be deemed an unlawful taking for the purpose of supporting an Action of Replevin?’” 


Prior to this development, if B merely detained goods which he had acquired lawfully, A had to proceed in 
Detinue and could not replevy the goods on the basis of an unlawful detention. Replevin was in this respect like the 
statutory Summary Proceedings for Forcible Entry on Land. It contemplated the situation where property, being in 
the peaceable possession of A, is seized by B. Provisionally, the status quo is at once restored, pending the 


Page 271 of 735 


settlement of the controverted right. In Form the Action proceeds for Damages, but, if the plaintiff fails, the 
defendant will be given Judgment for the return of the chattels—the horse and plough. 


After the provisional remedy of immediate delivery is granted both parties, as we have seen, become actors 
in the suit; the plaintiff to be vindicated in his possession and to recover Damages, while the defendant is like a 
plaintiff asserting his claim to the chattels. The pleading by which the landlord-defendant prayed for their return 
was formerly called an Avowry or Cognizance, which was in the nature of a Cross-Declaration. It followed 
therefore that the tenant’s next pleading, instead of being a Replication, was a Plea, with all other pleadings in 
consequence being deferred an additional stage, as compared with an ordinary action. 


When is the Action Available—Nature of the Property 


TO support Replevin, the property must be personal. The Action will not lie for taking property so 
attached to the freehold as to acquire the character of immovable fixtures,

or real property; nor does it lie to recover growing crops or timberY But it will lie for removable fixtures, such as 
tenant’s fixtures; and it will lie for things previously attached to the freehold, and for crops and growing timber 
which have been severed and converted into personal property.’ Replevin cannot be maintained for money which 
has no identifying marks or receptacle.”

tention; these distinctions were obliterated by modern statutes extending the scope of Replevin to include Detinue. 
Replevin and Trespass were to be distinguished, in the sense that Replevin assumed property in the plaintiff, 
whereas Trespass assumed property in the tortfeasor. Otherwise Replevin became to a considerable extent a 
concurrent remedy with Detinue and Trespass; and later with Trover. 

IT was early settled that Replevin would lie upon any wrongful taking. In consequence, Gascoigne, C. 3., in a 
case decided in 1406,18 said that Replevin was concurrent with Trespass. In theory, therefore, one who was 
disseised of a chattel might elect to sue in Detinue, Replevin and Trespass. If he sued in Detinue he might 
recover the chattel, or if it was not available, then he might recover its value, but it remained in 
the defendant’s hands until the action was completed. If he sued in Replevin, he reacquired the chattel as his 
own, plus damages for the wrongful detention. If he sued in Trespass, he could recover damages for the full 
value of the chattel, as the action proceeded on the theory that the property had vested in the tortfeasor.'° Still 
later, in more modern times, the Action of Trover also became available against a trespasser who took and 
converted chattels to his own use. But for some reason, not quite clear, Replevin did not become popular as a 
concurrent remedy with Trespass. Street'® suggests that the explanation may lie in the circumstance that in 
Bracton’s day Replevin was subject to Wager of Law, or it may have been due to the fact that the defendant- 
land-

my choice to ~valve property or not”

lord might sidetrack the action by raising an issue as to the ownership of the chattels 

—the horse and plough. 


Page 273 of 735 


But while Replevin and Detinue were concurrent in a certain sense, they were to be distinguished with respect to 
the return of the chattel pending a determination of the matter of right between the parties. Of course, this distinction 
evaporated under modern statutes merging the two actions. And as we have seen, Replevin was to be dis- 
tinguished from Trespass, the one being available where the property in the chattel remains in the plaintiff, the other 
being available where the plaintiff chooses to assume the property to be in the trespasser. 


FORMS OF THE ORIGINAL WRIT, PLAINT, DECLARATION AND BOND IN 
REPLEVIN 


129. This section contains Forms of the Original Writ, Plaint, Declaration and Bond in the Action of 
Replevin, 


The Original Writ in Replev4n 

THE Original Writ in R.eplevin gave the Action a dual character; it furnished an expeditious method by 
which the tenant could immediately regain possession of the horse and plough, and it authorized a hearing as an 
incident thereof to determine the legality of the alleged wrongful taking and detention, and award Damages, and 
at one stage in the 
development of the Action this hearing 
might be held before the Sheriff. Viewed from the standpoint of the first command of the Writ, the Action 
appears to be a proceeding to regain possession of personal property wrongfully taken and detained, and it 
has been so viewed by some authors.~’ Viewed from the standpoint of the second command of the Writ, the Action 


appears to be a Proceeding to Recover Damages for the unlawful taking and detention of personal property,

ACTION OF REPLEVIN

and it has been so defined by Saunders,” Stephen 23 and Tidd.” Despite statements which have been 
construed to the contrary,” no case of Replevin appears which has not been commenced with a Writ requiring the 
Sheriff jo cause the goods to be replevied, or by Plaint to the Sheriff, followed by a precept to replevy the 
goods. 


The two proceedings, in reality, were never separate and independent of each other. The recovery of 
the goods under the first command of the Writ was only provisional, that is, it restored possession of the chattels 
to the plaintiff, pending proceedings under the second command to do justice; if the plaintiff failed to 
make out his case, the chattels of necessity were returned to the def end-ant. The dual character of the 
Original Writ in fteplevin will appear in the Form of the Original Writ set out below. 


Distinction Between Hepievin in the Detinuit and Replevin in the Detinet 

AT Common Law Replevin in the detinet lay for a wrongful detention of goods taken under a lawful distress 
for rent.” But in practice the action was usually confined to cases of wrongfui distress, such as a wrongful 
distress for rent, damage feasant, sewers’ rates, and the like.”

28. Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. III, Personal Actions Ex Delicto, Art. V. Beplevin, 93, 96 (St. Paul, 1905). 

The Modem Form of the Action of Replevin is in the detinuit, which is so called because, as the word 
imparts, it is brought when the goods have been delivered by the Sheriff to the plaintiff.” Replevin in the 
detinet lay to recover goods which were still detained, but it has long been obsolete. It follows therefore that when 
Replevin in the detinet was available, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the value of the goods as well as 
Damages for their taking; 30 whereas in Replevin in the detinuit, the plaintiff was entitled to recover only 
Damages for the wrongful taking. 


Wilkinson -: understood that there were two kinds of Replevin—one in the detinuit and the other in the detiiwt. 
But Martin suggests that this supposition was the direct outgrowth of a reasonable Variation in the Declaration, 
turning on whether the Sheriff found or failed to find the property. If the property was found and delivered to the 
plaintiff, the plaintiff then declared in the detinuit, describing the wrong for which he claimed Damages as an 
accomplished act of the past.” In this Form of the Declaration, it was alleged that the goods taken “were 
detained until replevied by the Sheriff’ a phrase which came to be abbreviated by alleging that they were 
“detained until, etc.,” which was called “Declaring in the Detinuit””’ As the Sheriff was usually successful in 
delivering the hone and plough, this was the more usual Declaration; it was filed after the result of the 
Sheriff’ s action was known, and Damages were only for the orig

inal wrongful taking and past detention by the landlord-defendant.™ If, however, he was unable to find and 
return the horse and plough to the tenant, the plaintiff might, at his option, compel the defendant to answer for the 
wrongful taking and detention, in Damages, in which case he declared in the detinet. In such an instance the 
plaintiff recovered Damages for the continued detention of the chattels, which was inclusive of the full value of the 
chattels taken and still detained, as well as Damages for the wrongful taking?” The same Declaration could be a 


detinuit as to the part returned, and Q definet as to the residue not found or returned.”° 


Martin suggests that there probably never was a distinct Action of Replevin in the detinet, but that there was 
also probably never a time when, after issue of the Replevin Writ, the plaintiff could not declare in the detinet if the 
Sheriff failed to redeliver the goods, as it was quite clear that unless he did so, he could not recover the value 
of the chattels.” 


In any event it seems evident that the Variation in the Form of Declaration had no effect in changing the action; 
but went only to the Measure of Damages, and this ceased to be necessary, as under the Declaration in the cietinuit, 
as finally developed, the Courts permitted the plaintiff to show that the goods were still detained, so as to bring their 
value into the assessment, and hence to that end the value was alleged in the Declaration

in the detinuit?® As present detention might be treated as a continuation of the original taking and detention, as it 
went only to the Measure of Damages, and not to the right of action, it became unnecessary to declare in the detinet, 
and this may explain why this latter Form of Declaration in Replevin became obsolete. 


It should be observed, however, that the Writ was always in the detinet, and that the Modern Action of 
Replevin in many American States, being instituted before the issuance of the Writ or Order, is usually in that form. 


The Venue in Replevin is Local,” but the Venue in an Action on the Bond is transitory.*° And the goods must 


be stated with certainty in the Declaration, but certainty to a general intent is sufficient.

ALLEGATIONS; (1) INGENERAL 


130. The Essential Allegations of the Declaration are: 
(D The plaintiff’s Title to Certain Goods at the Commencement of the Action; 


(ID The Unlawful Taking and Detention; or by Statute in Some States, an Unlawful Detention only; 


(II) The Demand and refusal in Certain 
Cases; 
(w) The Damages 
The property must be described sufficiently for identification, but the right of the plaintiff may be 
generally stated. 


AS has been stated before, the property which is the subject of this action must be personal, and such as is 
capable of definite description and of delivery; and, in describing it in the Declaration, care and accuracy must be 
used, since the question of identification is an important one. Where the chattels taken and detained are in their 
nature distinguishable from an others of a similar kind, less particularity of description is required than when they 
are not so distinguishable. In the latter case the Declaration must go further, and show what indicia or earmarks 
are peculiar to them.” The plaintiff should Count on the identical chattels replevied, and no more or less, as the 
defendant might be entitled to a Judgment for the return of a larger or the correct number, though not a number less 
than actually in question; ~ and the Declaration should also state their value correctly, though the strictness 
formerly necessary is not now required.” In brief, here, as in all cases where specific property is in question, the 
statement must be sufficiently accurate and complete for the Court and Jury to see that the property as to which 
evidence is offered is the same as that referred to in the pleadings. 

The practice in bringing Actions of Replevin is now almost universally regulated by statute, and the statutes must 
therefore be consulted. In some states the Declaration is not used at all, but an Affidavit takes its place. In these 
cases the Affidavit must comply with the rules above stated, for it must, like a Declaration, show facts constituting a 
cause of action,

TO support Replevin, the plaintiff must have and must allege such a property in the goods, either General or 
Special, as entitled him to the immediate possession of them, as against the defendant. It is not sufficient to allege 
that the plaintiff was “entitled to the possession of the goods”; the Declaration should aver that the articles 
were the “goods and chattels of the plaintiff” at the time of the taking.“ If he cannot show this, the action must fail, 
without regard to whether the defendant has any title, or not; for the action must be maintained, if at all, on the 
strength of the plaintiff's own title and right.“ Even though he may

either before default in payment, nor after such default, but before expiration of the time during which the mortgagor may retain possession.

The action may be supported by the mortgagee of chattels upon eonthtion broken. Illinois: Cleaves v. 
Right of Possession is the ground Of the action, rather than General Ownership. 


In reason, it would seem to be clear that the right of the plaintiff to possession of the property, as against 
the defendant, should be the only question to be determined, and that actual title should only be material in so far as 
it determines this right. In some states, however, it is held that mere posses. 
sion at the time of the unlawful taking of property by one without any authority at ali is not enough to support 
Replevin, though it might be sufficient to support Trover; that either a General or Special ownership must be 
shown, even as against a mere wrongdoer; and that, for instance, one who has the care of goods merely for safe- 
keeping, without any interest in them, cannot maintain the action.” In some states, on the other hand, no title 
need be shown, as against

authority, the mere prior possession will support the action against the latter.°° 


The mere custody of a servant or agent is an insufficient basis to enable him to bring Replevin for a wrongful

A Tenant in common cannot maintain Replevin against his co-tenant.!* And it is held in some states that one 
tenant in common of goods cannot alone maintain this action; that he cannot, for instance, maintain it against an 
officer who attaches the goods as the sole property of the other owner.” “Replevin,” said the Massachusetts Court, 
“is an action founded on the General or Special property of the plaintiff, and it is settled that, when a chattel is 


Page 281 of 735 


illegally taken and detained, all the part owners must join in Replevin; and it is a good Plea in Abatement that the 
property is in the plain- 

tiff and another.” ~ 

This would not apply 

to the full extent in those states where it is held that mere possession at the time of the unlawful taking of goods, 
without any other title, is sufficient to support Replevin against the wrongdoer.”°

132. The Declaration must show such an interference by the defendant as subjects him to liability in Replevin 
under the Jaws of the particular state. At Common Law it was necessary to allege a wrongful taking; but, by 
statute, in many states an unlawful detention of the chattel at the time of the suit, is sufficient. And the 
general rule is that the defendant must have possession at the time of Commencing the Suit. 


In Gencral 


THOUGH, as we have seen, Replevin was originally used in cases in which property had been illegally taken in 
distress, it is not so limited now, but will lie in any case where the goods have been wrongfully taken and wrongfully 
detained, provided, of course, the plaintiff is entitled to their possession.” An unlawful deteption, without an 
unlawful taking, is not enough. 


title. MeArthur v. Oliver, 60 Mich. 605, 27 NW. 689 (1886). 


But in order to maintain the action, a tenant in common must show something more than his undivided ownership; he, at least, must show that he 
was in possession. Hess v. Griggs, 43 Mich. 307, 5 KW. 427 (1850). 


One partner can bring fleplevin for the whole partnership property, if it is seized on Execution for another’s individual debt. Hutehinson v.

At Common Law, the Action would only lie where the property was tortiously or unlawfully taken from the 
actual or constructive possession of the plaintiff, a Trespass in the taking being absolutely essential, and this is still 
the rule in some of our states.” Under such circumstances the action is called “Replevin in the Cepit.” 


In many other states, however, the remedy by Replevin has been extended by Statute, that is, so as to embrace 
these cases in which property has been lawfully obtained, but unlawfully detained, as under a contract. k these it will 
lie where the property was wrongfully taken, or where, through possession was originally acquired lawfully, the 
property is wrongfully detained.”

ACTION OF JUPLEVIN 
267 

Some Form of Action for Damages should be brought if the defendant has not the actual possession of the 
property when the action is commenced, for the remedy is proprietary and enforces the right of possession. While 
the Action is primarily for the recovery of possession, the same facts which show a wrongful obstruction of the right 
of property show also a tort, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover Damages which he has suffered by the wrongful 
taking or detention, and also the value of the goods in case the property itself cannot be 1’ ad. 


The defendant must In all cases have actual or apparent possession and control of the property at the time the 
action is commenced. If the property has been lost or destroyed, or disposed of by him to the plaintiff’ s knowledge, 
the action will not lie, but the plaintiff must bring Trespass or Trover.°° But if the defendant has been in the 
unlawful possession of the property, and the plaintiff brings Replevin without reason to know of any change in the 
circumstances, the defendant cannot defeat the action by showing that, unknown to the plaintiff, he had disposed

One cannot bring Rep)evia for property actually in his own possessioa against an officer who has merely levied on it. Iliekey v. Hinsdalc, 12 
Mich. 99 (1863). It is not always necessary, however, that goods levied on shall have been actually removed, in order to constitute such a 
change of possession from the owner to the officer as will entitle the owner to maintain Beplevin. Michigan: O’connor v. Gidday, 63 Mich. 
630, 30 N.W. 313 (1886); Gutsch 
v. Mcllhargey, 69 Mich. 377, 37 NW. 303 (1888); New York: Fonda v. Van home, 15 Wend. (N.Y.) 631, 30 Aatflee. 77 (1836). 


Thus, where property was seized on an Attachment, an inventory made, and a portion of tIle goods packed up in a trunk, but left in the owner’s 
office, and a portion wag removed, and the key of the office was retained for a time by the officer, it was held that this was a sufficient 
change of possession

The Action, by Statute, Becomes Tran.sitory 


FROM the early use of this action as a remedy for a wrongful distress the place of taking became a material fact, 
to be truly laid and proved.”* The strictness of this rule has been much relaxed, however, and in some of the states 
the action is now made transitory, but it seems still necessary that the Venue should be laid in the county in which 
the Cause of Action arose. Clearly, it should be accurately stated when such place is involved as a matter of essential 
description. Should it not be within the plaintiff's power to ascertain the true locality, he may, it ~eems, aver a 
taking and detention, or a detention only, at any place where the property has been discovered in the possession of 
the defendant.” 


When a Demand May be Necessary 


A DEMAND is not necessary before bringIng the Action, where the possession of the property was wrongfully 
obtained, as under a void sale by a pound master, or under an execution against a third person, or where the 
defendant acquired possession by fraud or trespass, or a sale voidable for fraud, so long as the goods are in the hands of 
the buyer.” On the other hand, in those states,

The Allegation of value is essential, and such general and special damages as are present should be stated, and 
laid high enough to cover the actual loss. 


As the object of this action is the recovery of the thing itself, the damages recoverable wifl be generally for the 
unlawful taking and detention, or for the latter where the taking is justified; and the allegation here referred to is the 
statement of at least a nominal sum in the declaration to cover the loss so sustained,~~ An allegation of some 
damage is always essential,”* and the plaintiff may often recover compensation for the use of the property, as well as 


vindictive or punitive damages, and damages may be assessed up to the time of the trial.

ACTION OF REPLEVIN 
269 
The Judgment 


ASSUMING that the Sheriff had found and delivered the distrained chattel to the plaintiff-tenant, in the action 
which followed the Judgment for the plaintiff was for the recovery of Damages for the taking and detention of the 


chattels—the horse and plough 
—together with costs.”” Where the property was not returned to the plaintiff, he recovered in addition the value of 


Page 285 of 735 


the property still detained.”” 


In the event of a Judgment by default, where the Damages were not confessed, a Writ of Inquiry issued to 
assess them, the amount of which turned on the result of the Sheriff’s effort to recover the chattels in question.” 


The nature of the Judgment, when for the defendant, varied. But under the general Common Law Rule he was 
adjudged return 

of the property, without Damages or costs,’2 If the defendant proceeded under the Statute of 7 Hen. VIII (1515) ,- 
which provided that 

-the recoverer may distrain for the rents and services of the tenant, fermor, etc., and 21 Hen. VII (1529) - which 
provided that the avowant shall recover damages and costs of suit, he recovered, after Verdict in his favor, his 
Damages and costs, in the same manner as the plaintiff might have done, if he had

recovered from the defendant.”” By the Statute of 17 Car. II (1665) zs when Judgment was given on Demurrer for 
the defendant Avowing or making Cognizance for any rent, he was entitled to a Writ of Inquiry as to the value of the 
property distrained, and a Judgment for the arrears of rent admitted by the Judgment to the amount of the value of 
the property distrained, together with Costs.” Apparently, it was optional with the defendant whether he would take 
Judgment under this last Statute alone, or in addition to the Common-Law, Judgment for a return of the property. If, 
however, the Judgment were taken under the Statute along with the Common-Law Judgment for a return, it operated 
as a stay of the Writ for the Return of the goods. If, under Section 21 of the same Chapter and Statute, the plaintiff 
was nonsuited before issue joined, the defendant was entitled to an Inquiry as to the amount of rent in arrear, and the 
value of the property distrained, upon which finding Judgment went in his favor as on Demurrer. In such case he 
had the option to sue out the Writ of Return, or have Execution for the Damages.’”

STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, 
PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 
13t Under Modern Codes and Practice Acts Replevin is generally Expanded so as to cover all forms of 

taking, whether lawful or unlawful, and may be maintained in circumstances where either Replevin or Detinue 
would lie at the Common Law. 


AS we have previously observed in Mennic 


Page 286 of 735 


v. Bialcc -and Harwood v. Smethtirst,°° the English and American Court refused, by 

Judicial Legislation, to extend Replevin so 

as to include a Detinue factual situation. But what the Courts refused to do by Judicial Legislation was subsequently 
accomplished by legislation which, in general, provided that for the purpose of supporting an Action of Replevin an 
unlawful taking was not necessary. As a result of this development, and entirely aside from the Codes, Detinue was in 
effect abolished and Replevin expanded in scope so as to cover all forms of taking, whether lawful or 
unlawful. 


This was the situation when the Codes 

purported to abolish the Common Law Actions, What effect, then, has the Code had upon the Action? The 
answer to this question may be found in the 1901 New York case of Sinnott v. Felock,”’ in which the plaintiff 
brought an action to recover certain chattels, which the Court referred to as an Action of Replevin, and in which it 
was alleged the plaintiff has been induced to sell the chattels to the defendant by fraud on the part of the 
latter. In his Opening Statement the plaintiff’s counsel conceded that prior to a demand for the return of the 
goods and before the Commencement of the Action, the chattels had been taken from the defendant on an 
Execution against him and sold, so that at the time of such

demand and Commencement of the Action, they were not in the defendant’s control, custody or possession. On this 
concession, the Trial Court dismissed the Complaint and 

the Judgment entered on such dismissal was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The Court of Appeals stated that the 
issue presented was: whether the defendant was liable in an Action of Replevin for the recovery of chattels after 
they have been taken from him by process legal as to him and not by any voluntary act on his part? 


The determination of this issue turned, therefore, upon an examination and consideration of the Action of 
Replevin as it existed under the New York Code arid Statutes. In affirming the Judgment for defendant, and in 
speaking for the Court of Appeals, Cullen, J., declared: s2 

“Originally at Common Law the Action of Replevin lay to recover the possession of goods illegally distrained by a 
landlord. The primary object of the Action was to recover possession of the specific chattels, The Form of 
Action was so useful that the action was extended to nearly all cases of unlawful caption or detention of chattels 
where it was sought to recover the chattels in specie. In many cases where the plaintiff was unable to obtain 
the return of the chattels he could recover in the action their value. Still, the action remained essentially one to 
recover the possession of chattels as distinguished from actions in Trespass or Trover to recover Damages for the 
seizure or for the value of the property. There were many technical rules in force relating to this Form of Action, 
which at times made proceedings under it difficult, and in 1788 a Statute was passed in this state (1 Rt.1813, p. 31) 
to simplify the procedure. It directed the form of plaint before the Sheriff in which the plea was ‘of taking and 


unjustly detaining’ beasts, goods or chattels. Afterwards, the Revised

568, 80 Am,St.Rep. 736, 739 (1901). 


Sec. 134 
ACTION OF REPLEVIN 
271 

Statutes prescribed the rules governing actions of Replevin and the procedure therein. (Title 12, chap. 8, part 3.) In 
the original note of the revisers is stated their intention to so extend the Action of Replevin ‘as to make it a 
substitute for Detinue, and a Concurrent Remedy in all cases of the unlawful caption or detention of personal 
property, with Trespass and Prover.’ We do not think the revisers used the term ‘Concurrent’ as meaning ‘Co- 
extensive,’ for by Section 6, title 12, it is provided that the Action shall in all cases be commenced by Writ, the Form 
of which is prescribed as follows: ‘Whereas A.B. complains that C.D. has taken, and does unjustly detain (or, 
“does unjustly detain,” as the case may be).’ 


Page 287 of 735 


“The Execution in the Action required the Sheriff to Replevin the goods if they could be found and deliver them 
to the plaintiff, and in case they could not be obtained to collect their value with the damages and costs from the 
property of the defendant. The provisions of chapter 2 of title 7 of the Code of Procedure of 1848, entitled 
‘Claim and Delivery of Personal Property,’ operated as a substitute for those of the Revised Statutes. They 
direct that at the Commencement of the Action the plaintiff may replevy the chattels, but in the Affidavit to obtain 
the writ there is required the statement that the defendant ‘unjustly detains’ them. The provisions of the present Code 
of Civil Procedure in the article entitled ‘Action to recover a chattel’ (§ 1689 to § 1730), are substantially the 
same as those of the old Code. 


“The question several times arose, under the Code of Procedure whether Replevin could be maintained against a 
party who was not in possession, either actual or constructive, of The chattels, and was the subject of conflicting 
decisions in the Supreme Court and in the Superior Court of New York. It finally came to this Court in Nich- 
ols v. Michael, (23 N.Y. 264) This was also a ease of fraudulent purchase of goods 
in which the defendant, before the action was brought, had voluntarily transferred the goods to his assignee. It was 
held that the Action could be maintained. --: 


“It is urged that whatever may have been 

originally the nature and character of an Action of Replevin, there is now no longer reason for maintaining a 
distinction between it and an Action for Conversion, and that it would conduce greatly to the speedy administration 
of justice to permit the use of the first Form of Action as a substitute for the second. A good deal may be said in 
favor of this claim, great as would be the innovation resulting in its acceptance. There is, however, a serious 
objection to adopting this view of an Action of Replevin. If a defendant is arrested in an Action to recover a chattel 
he can be discharged only upon giving a bond for the return of the chattel or the full payment of any judgment that 
may be recovered against him; while in an Action for Conversion the bond is conditioned only for his personal 
surrender to any mandate or final Judgment against him. (Code Civ. Pro. ~ 575.) The Form of the Action, therefore, 
seriously affects the rights of the defendant against whom it is brought. While this consideration should not induce 
us to limit the Scope of an Action of Replevin except within the bounds prescribed by Statute and the 
authorities, it may well restrain us from taking any radical departure in the Law.” sa 


83. Section 1093 of the New York Civil Practice Act, which provided that a rleferdnnt, liv answer, could defend on the ground that a third person 
was entitled to the chattel, without conncctin~ himself with a latter’s title, was held not applicable to wrongful taking cases; it was applicable 
to the wrongful detention cases. Griffin! Receiver v. fling Island By. CO., 101 N.Y. 348, 4 N.E. 740 (1886); Hofferinan v. Simmons, 290 N.Y. 
449, 49 N.E.(2d) 523 (1943). For an extended discussion of the New York decisions and Statutes see Article by Finkelstein, The Plea of 
Property in a Stranger in Replevin, 23 col.L.Rev. 652 (1923). Section 7101 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, 1968, provides 
that, “An action under this article may be brought to try the

in this and succeeding chapters consider the allegations necessary to show liability in the Contract Actions of 
Debt, Covenant, Account, Special Assumpsit and General (Indebitatus) Assumpsit. 


Prima Facie Case in Contract Actions 


IN Contract Actions the plaintiffs prima fac-ie case consists in showing the normal affirmative elements of a 
valid contract and the coming into operation of an affirmative contractual duty; on the other hand, negative 
elements, such as fraud or illegality, which destroy the validity of the contract, and Matters of Excuse and 
Discharge, as impossibility, performance, or release, must come from the defendant, to prevent plaintiff's recovery. 
Thus, where the plaintiff has proved the existence of the debt sued on, the burden of proving payment is on the 
defendant. The plaintiff must allege nonpayment of the money demand to make the Declaration perfect on its face; 
but payment is an Affirmative Defense, even in many jurisdictions where it may be raised by the defendant under a 
Deniai. Thus negative averments may be necessary to the plaintiff s pleading, though they constitute no part of 
his original substantive cause of action which he is called upon to prove or establish.

Comment: To Gaol for Debt In WisconsIn, 1952 Wis. LRev. 764. 

In Actions upon Contracts for Damages, the plaintiff must assign the breach by the defendant which is relied 
upon as ground for recovery, and allege the essential facts to apprise the defendant in what particulars he has 
failed to perform. But when the plaintiff pleads or proves the contract, and the fulfillment of conditions to create an 
operative duty of performance by the defendant as by tender or performance on his own part, it is then 
incumbent upon the defendant to prove performance, or sufficient excuse for nonperformance as an Affirmative 
Defense, without proof of breach on behalf of the plaintiff. Even the burden of proving the General Allegation of 
Performance by the plaintiff as a Condition Precedent is taken off the plaintiff in Modern English Practice, 
unless the defendant specially pleads nonperformance of some Condition. 


As the first of the Contract Actions we shall treat with the Action of Debt, and, as in the case of the Tort Actions, 
one of our principal considerations is, what facts must be alleged in order to state a good cause of action? 


SCOPE OF THE ACTION 


135. The Action of Debt lies where a party claims the recovery of a debt; that is, a liquidated or certain 
sum of money due him. The Action is based upon Contract, but the Contract may be Implied, either in Fact 
or in Law, as well as being Express; and it may be either a Simple Contract or a Specialty. The most common 
instances of its use are for debts: 

(D Upon Unilateral Contracts Express or Implied in Fact; 
(ID) Upon Quasi Contractual Obligations having the force and effect of Simple Contracts; 


(III) Upon Bonds and Covenants under Seal; 


(IV) Upon Judgments or Obligations of Record; 
(V) Upon Obligations Imposed by Statute. 
Sec. 135 

ACTION OF DEBT 
275 
The Action of Debt will not lie: 
(D To recover Unliquidated Damages for Breach of a Promise; 
(ID) Nor, generally, to recover an Installment of a Debt, payable in Installments before the Whole is Due; 
(III) Nor on a Promise to pay out of a Particular Fund, or in a Particular Kind of Money, or in Property 
or Services, 


The Nature of the Obligation 20f a Debt, Cawsa Debendi 
AS Debt was and, in its nature, is a Real Action, the object of which is to recover a yes which belongs to the 
plaintiff, it is proprietary in character,’ By this we mean 


2. The Action of Debt was the Common Law’s reinedy for the enforcement of its carliest known obligations. See article by Pollock, Contracts in 
Early English Law, 6 Harv.L.ltev. 50 (1893). 


3, “This Action of Debt was nothing in essence but an action in Detinue for the recovery of money unjustly detained, together with Damages for 
the said wrongful detention, such Damages being claimed, not in the Writ, but in the plaintiff’s first count,” See article by Stone, Debt at the 
Time of the Year Books, 30 L.Qdtev. 61, 62 (1920). See, also, 3 Holds-worth, History of English Law, c, Ill, Contract and Quasi-Contract, 
425 (3d ed. Boston, 1927). 


An Action for the Recovery of a Debt was thought of as like an action for the recovery of a book lent, or for the recovery of a plot of land 


Page 290 of 735 


which the defendant unjustly detained from the plaintiff. 


This crude and primitive Common-Law Conception of Debt, that the creditor was demanding the return of his own money, and that the action 
was “proprietary” or “reU,” seems to be somewhat overemphasized by many legal scholars. See article by Henry, Consideration In Contracts, 
601 A.D. to 1520 A.D., 26 Yale L.J. 664, 690—094 (1017). 


Debt was indeed a “proprietary action,” in the sense of being the vindication or enforcement of a right. The Judgment was not for Damages for 
breach of promise, but for recovery of the debt itself. Seo Chief Justice vaughan, in Edgeomb v. Dee, Vaughan 89, 124 Eng. Itep. 984 (1670); 
Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Lecture XIV, Implied Assumpsit, 148, 150—151 (Cambridge 1913). 


It is said that the duty to restore the money arose not because the debtor had promised or contracted to pay, but because of some transaction, as 
that he had borrowed It or received value, known as quid pro quo. But the promise or agreement to pay the 


it does not lie for Damages as reparation for a tort, nor does it proceed upon the theory that the plaintiff’s right to 
recover, or the defendant’s obligation to surrender the property sued for, is grounded upon a promise. The property 
sought, whether land, a corporeal chattel, or a sum of money, is demanded because the defendant is withholding 
something which rightfully belongs to the plaintiff. 


Œ Title as the Basis of the Action of Debt.—Thus, if the plaintiff is to recover, it must be on the basis of some 
form of title, clear of any claim grounded in tort and independent of any promise. There are two possibilities as to 
such title: (1) where the goods or money in issue were originally the property of the plaintiff and his claim to recover 
is based on a prior vested interest, 


price was just as much a part of the debt transaction as the delivery of the ‘-es. See article by Henry, Consideration in Contracts, 601 A.D. to 
1520 AD., 26 Yale Li. 664, 694 (1917), 


In Debt the word “agreed” must be used instead of “promised,” but this is mere form. MeGinnity v. Laguerenne, 5 Gil. (NL) 101 (1848). 


4. On Debt for the recovery of a specific amount of unaseertained chattels, see Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Lecture VIIJ, Debt, 89 
(Cambridge 1913). 


This action gives specific enforcement of the duty to pay. It gives the specific thing demanded, namely, the recovery of a debt eo nomine and in 
numero, and not merely the recovery of damages. | Chitty, Treatise oa Pleading and Parties to Action, with Precedents end Forms, c. II, Of the 
Forms of Action, 121 (16th Am, ed. by Perkins, Springfield 1876); 

Tennessee: Thoinpsoa v. French, 18 Tenn. 452 (1837); Virgi,ua: Minnick v. Williams, 77 Va. 758 (1883). 


The action does not lie for the breach of a sealed contract to convey land, or to recover purchase money paid. The action being for the breach, and 
not for a sum of money Co nornin,e and in nurne;-o, it should be Covenant. Haynes v, Lucas, 50 Ill. 436 (1869). 


It would lie to recover the purchase money as a debt arising from the obligation created by law to repay It as money had and received. The terms 


de 


sum 
certain” and debt & nomine and in numero are used to distinguish a claim for a liquidated debt from a claim for unliquidated damages, 
which are not ascertainable in amount.

as, for example, where A bailed a chattel to B, or B wrongfully took A’s chattel; or (2) where originally the property 
was the property of the defendant, the present possessor, but as a result of the happening of some subsequent event, 
he ought, debet, to deliver it to the plaintiff who has become entitled to recover it, If the plaintiff’s claim is based on 
a previously vested title, he is demanding the land, chattel or money as a jus in re, that is, a right which belongs to a 
person, absolutely and immediately, in a thing; if, however, the plaintiff’s claim is grounded on a right to a thing now 
in the defendant’s possession, a res which as yet has never been in the plaintiff's possession, but to which the 
plaintiff, by operation of law is presently entitled, this right of the plaintiff to have the thing is known as a jus ad 
rem, or a right which belongs to a person only mediately and relatively, and has for its foundation an obligation 
incurred by a particular person. 


In the Personal Action of Debt-Detinue, both forms of title were available, that is, the plaintiff in such action 
might recover because the goods or the money belonged to him originally or because, by operation of law, or 
otherwise, he had acquired a right to recover the property which as yet was still in the defendant’s possession. And it 
was this distinction as to title which ultimately led to the differentiation between Debt in the Detinet and Debt in 
the Debet et Detinet; that is, between the situation in which A bailed his horse, Damascus, to B, for thirty days 


Page 291 of 735 


and where A loaned .3 $500 for thirty days; in the first case, B acquired possession, but not title, hence when A 
sues B at the end of the thirty days, after demand, he is relying on a prior vested title, a jus in re; in the second 
case, B acquired both possession and title, hence when A sued B to recover the ~500, he was suing by virtue of an 
accruing title, a jus ad rem. 

(II) Debt in the Detinet, or for Goods not Pecuniary.—In theory at least that Form of the Action which lay for 


the recovery of a certain quantity of specified goods and chattels, may still be maintained upon an Executed Contract.”

or unplied. People v. Dummer, 274 Ill. 637, 111 N.E. 934 (1916). 


Simple Contract Debts, of course, must he founded on a quid pro quo or Executed Consideration. See article by Ames, Parol Contracts Prior to 
Assumpsit, S Harv.L.Rev, 252 (1895). 


It also lies to enforce a quasi contractual obligation to pay a sum certain. Van Deusen v. 13mm, 18 Pick. (Mass.) 229, 29 Am.Dee. 582 (1836). 


Debt also lies at the suit of a person entitled to costs in an action, either as a party or as an officer, there being an implied contract. Doyle v.

in which Debt was used to recover specific chattels was that of the Earl of Faimauth v. George,” decided in 
1828, in which the plaintiff sought to recover a certain number of fishes alleged to be due by way of toll for the use 
by the fishing boats of a capstan which the plaintiff maintained on the shore. The Action was said to be Debt in the 
detinet, the Allegation that the defendant debet, being omitted. In 1769 Blackstone observed that this Form of Debt 
was “neither more nor less than a mere Writ of Detinue,” 
and he insisted that nothing but money could 
constitute a debt, which view has been approved by certain American courts.” Keigwin, however, declares: “As a 
matter of historical fact, however, Detinue and Debt for goods have always been distinct, the former lying for goods 
previously the property of the plaintiff, and going upon his jus in re, while Debt in the detinet went for a body of 
goods to which, as to a sum of money, the plaintiff was entitled, proceeding upon his

Thus generally in all cases where the Consideration has been Executed and where there is an absolute duty to pay In money 
the value of the performance rendered, there Debt on Simple Contract or Indebitatus Assumpait is a proper 
remedy. Debt lies in all cases where the Law Courts can properly give 
specific performance of a duty to pay money, namely, where the duty Is an absolute one, not subject to any conditions.

jus ad rem.” ~ We are, therefore, concerned only with that Form of the Action of Debt which remained after 
Detinue split off from the main Trunk of the Tree; that is, that Form of Debt used to recover money debts, known as 
Debt in the debet et detinet,'° which, like its ancestor, the Real Action, seeks the recovery of a certain sum of 
money to which the plaintiff has a right by reason of the defendant’s legal duty to pay. 


For the plaintiff to recover in Debt, therefore, he must set forth in his Declaration a right to the thing 
demanded; that such right arises from something other than a promise or voluntary assumption; it must, in truth, be 
independent of what we now understand as a contractual obligation. Under the ancient law, matter which created in 
one person a right to something in the possession of another, was called a cau.sa debendi, or “a ground of 
indebtedness, a basis of the duty to deliver, the origin of an obligation to pay.”” As Pollock and Maitland said: 

“Tt enters no one’s head that a promise is the ground of this action. No pleader propounding such an action will think 
of beginning his Declaration with ‘whereas the defendant promised to pay,’ he will begin with ‘whereas the 
plaintiff lent or (as the

10. Where one of the parties to the Action of Debt died, the Form of Declaring was in Debt in the detinet, not in Debt in the dsbet et detinet. It was 


said that these distinctions, which require the Dcc~ laratlon tO be only in the detinet, where one of the original parties died, were held to 
be substantive as late as 1619. Beynell v. Langcastie, Croine. 545, 79 Eng.Rep. 467. A defect as to wording was, however, only 
available on Special Demurrer after tile Statute of 4 Anne, e. 16, ~ 1 (1705). Child ress v. Emory, S Wheat. (U.S.) 642. But according to 1 
Chitty, Treatise on Pleading and Parties to Actions, with Precedents and Forms, e. III, Of Pleading in General, 284, note b (16th 


Am. ed. by Perkins, Springfield, 1876), an Improper use of the word 
“debet” was not even subject to a Special Demurrer, being treated as mere surplusage.

case may be) sold or leased to the defendant.’ In short, he will mention some causa debendi, and the cause will not 
be a promise.” 12 


(TM) A Parol Promise Created No Obligation During the Developmental Stages of Debt.—Let us, by way of 
illustration, suppose that A undertook to sell his horse, Damascus, to B, the defendant, in exchange for two steers, 
that A delivered Damascus to B, and that B thereupon refused to deliver the steers, but retains them in his 
possession. Clearly A is entitled to recover the steers. But is this so because B has Executed a Contract Obligating 
himself to make delivery? Certainly not, and, if this were the only basis of A’s claim, he could not have recovered; 
the Court might well have told him that he deserved to lose his horse because of his folly in trusting B’s word. In 
other words, at the time when Debt was reaching maturity, a parol promise, which several Centuries later became 
enforceable in Special Assuinpsit, created no legal obligation; the obligation, if any, was merely moral, and hence 


Page 293 of 735 


not justiciable. In such a case, however, A would recover, as B has received a benefit at his expense, and one who 
profits by the act of another ought, debet, to compensate that other in a manner commensurate with the benefit 
conferred. Or to put it in technical language, B, having received .4’s horse, ought to render a quid pro quo, or the 
steers, as a balance against the horse, the so-called “Executed Consideration.” Thus, where a Simple Contract has 
been executed on one side so as to transfer a quid pro quo, or a benefit to the other side, the benefit received creates 
in the receiver, by operation of Jaw, a legal duty to render an equivalent benefit to the plaintiff, that is, it creates an 
indebtedness, which may be regarded as an example of causa debendi. And these causa debendi, vaguely 
understood 

in the early stages of development, gradually took on definite form, and were ultimately clarified la as being derived 
from three sources, Simple Contracts, Specialties and Records, including Statutes. 


DEBT—DISTINGUISHED FROM AND CONCURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 


136. Debt was distinguished from Special .Assumpsit in that it Jay for the recovery of a Sum Certain; 
whereas the latter was for the recovery of Damages; Debt was a concurrent remedy with Indebitatus Assumpsit in the 
field of Simple (Executed) Contract, but in being available upon Specialties, Records and Statutes, it was broader 
than the latter action. Debt and Covenant were concurrent remedies where the Dnmages upon breach of the Sealed 
Instrument were liquidated. And Debt, Special Assumpsit and Indebitatus Assumpsit were concurrent remedies, 
where, over and above a Simple (Executed) Contract, there was also an Express Promise which had been breached. 


SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT is to be distinguished from Debt, in that it lies for the Breach of a Modern Contract, in 
which what is recovered is Damages, whereas, when we say that Debt lies on a Simple Contract. we are referring to 
the early Common-Law Concept of what is termed “a Simple Executed Contract,” which term is descriptive not of a 
contract in the modern sense, but in the sense that the plaintiff has delivered a quid pro quo to the defendant, for 
which the defendant has failed to pay, or has otherwise become indebted to the plaintiff by operation of law. And it 
is of course settled, as previously observed, that Debt will not lie upon a promise for a promise,’ as in such 


12. On the early attempts at classifying the varieties of debt, see Fifoot, History and Sources of the Common Law, e. 10, Debt, 223 (London 
1049), in which he cites a ease in which it was said that ‘each writ of Debt is general and in one form, but the count is Special and makes 
mention of the Contract, the Obligation or the Record, as the case requires.” Anonymous. TM, li lien. JV, f. 73, pl. 11 (1410).

case there is no guid pro guo passing to the defendant. 


Debt is to be distinguished from Indebitatus Assurnpsit, being in many respects much broader than the latter 
action. It is true that Debt and Indebitatus Assumpsit are concurrent remedies in the Field of Simple (Executed) 
Contract, but Tndebitatus Assumpsit will not lie upon a Sealed Contract, a Record, or, with some exceptions, upon 
a Statute. In the sense that Indebitatus Assumpsit came to be the remedy for recovery of Quasi-Contractual 
Obligations through the use of the Common Counts, it may be said to be broader than Debt. This advantage was later 
lessened by the fact that in some jurisdictions Debt also came to be recognized as a Quasi-Contractual Remedy, by a 
process which is not clear. And, of course, Debt was subject to Wager of Law, whereas Indebitatus Assumpsit was 
not, and it was this fact which led to the obsolescence of Debt some time after ,Slade’s Case ıs when the Two Actions 
were concurrent remedies on a Simple (Executed) Contract. 


Generally, Debt and Covenant are exclusive remedies, except where the amount of Damages due upon the breach 
of a sealed instrument are liquidated. In such instance, Debt and Covenant are concurrent remedies; where, however, 
the Damages upon Breach of a Specialty are unliquidated, Covenant is the only remedy.’°

1895). 


sit, were concurrent remedies. To illustrate, let us suppose that A says to B, “I will deliver ten cords of wood to you at 
five dollars a cord,” to which B replies, “Go ahead and deliver it and I will pay for it.” A then delivers the wood, but 
B refuses to pay. Debt will lie, for a guid pro quo—a benefit—has passed from A to B and B has failed to give A 
what, by operation of law, belongs to him. Indebitatus Assumpsit will lie as it is a concurrent remedy with Debt on 
Simple (Executed) Contract; and Special Assumpsit will also lie, because over and above the benefit received by 
B—the delivery of the wood—the defendant B has breached his express promise to pay. Thus, Debt, Special 
Assumpsit, and Indebitatus Assumpsit were concurrent remedies, where, over and above a Simple (Executed) 
Contract, there was also an Express Promise which had been breached.

indebted to another. In both eases the Judgment establishes the plaintiff s right to the money or the chattel and at the same time imposes 
upon the defendant a duty to pay the money declared due or to deliver the specific chattel to the complainant. Once the indebtedness is 
established by a Record, Debt, by reason of its proprietary nature, becomes an effective remedy.

DECLARATION IN DEBT—ESSENTIAL AL 
LEGATIONS: (1) INGENERAL 


138. The Essential Allegations of the Declaration are: 
(I) In Debt on Simple (Executed) Contract: 


(A) A Statement of the Debt and 
quid pro quo; 


(B) The Breach—Nonpayment ; 
(C) The Damages. (II) In Debt on Specialty: 
(A) A Statement of the Execution of the Specialty; 
(B) Nonpayment by the def end- 
ant 
(C) The Damages (III) In Debt on Statutes: 
(A) A Statement of the Act or Omission in Violation of the Statute; 
(B) Nonpayment of the Debt or Penalty; 
(C) The Damages 
(W) InDebton Judgments: 
(A) A Statement of the Judgment; 
(B) Nonpayment or Nonsatisfaction; 
(C) The Damages 
For Sum Certain Only 
THE Mode of Stating the Cause of Action in Debt varies according to the source or basis of the 
obligation, which may be either a Simple (Executed) Contract, a Specialty, a Statute, or a Judgment. However, before 


Page 297 of 735 


considering the Essential Allegations applicable to each of the Four Varieties of Debt, 
it may be helpful to discuss in more detail the requirement that the action must be for a sum certain—a requirement 
which is common in each of the Four Forms of Debt. 


The action of Debt lies only for a liquidated sum of money; that is, a pecuniary demand where the amount due is 
fixed and specific or where it can readily be reduced to certainty by a mathematical computation. Blackstone tells us 
that in an Action of Debt the plaintiff must prove the whole debt he claims, or recover nothing at all, for the debt is 
only a single cause of action fixed and determined, and which, therefore, if the proof varies from the claim, cannot 
be looked upon as the same contract whereof the performance is sued for. “If, therefore, I bring an action for £30, I 
am not at liberty to prove a debt of £20 and recover a Verdict thereon, any more than, if I bring an Action of Detinue 
for a horse, I cannot thereby recover an ox.” 20 


In Rudder v. Price,” however, Lord Loughborough says, that while the demand in an Action of Debt must have 
been for a sum certain in its nature, yet it was by no means so necessary that the amount be set out precisely that less 
could not be recovered.” A promise to pay so much as certain services or goods were worth would not formerly 
support a Count in Debt, as the price

unliquidated damages, that is sufficiently certain. 


Debt will not lie, for instance, for a refusal to convey shares in a building according to the terms of a contract 
under seal. The remedy is by Action of Covenant.” Neither wifi Debt lie for breach of a promise of indemnity 
against loss or damage by fire contained in a fire insurance policy, although on principle this may well be questioned 
as the duty to pay is absolute.” 


Debt will not lie on a guaranty contract, as on a promise to pay the debt of another in consideration of 
forbearance, etc.,”° or in some jurisdictions against the indorser of a bill or note, or by an indorsee against the

alleged for the detention of the debt.

DECLARATION IN DEBT—ESSENTIAL AL 
LEGATIONS: (2) IN DEBT ON SIMPLE (EXECUTED) CONTRACT 


.139. In Debt on Sinipic (Executed) Contract, 
the Declaration must allege facts showing that the defendant received a quid pro quo, that is, the receipt of 
value from which, by operation of law, the debt arises; in addition it must allege, by 
way of the Breach, Nonpayment of the Debt, and Damages. 


BEFORE discussing the problem of stating a cause of action in Debt as applied to Simple Contracts, it is essential 
to consider the distinction between what were called Executed Contracts at Common Law and what are considered as 
Contracts Under Modem Law; also the distinction between Executed and Executory contracts as they originated at 
Common Law, together with some of the characteristics and peculiarities of each. Thereafter, with an understanding 
of the source or basis of the obligation sought to be enforced, we may intelligently consider the essential obligations 
necessary to state a good cause of action in Debt. 


Executed Contracts 


BOTH an Executed and an Executory Contract, if broken, will subiect the parties who commit a breach, to 
liability, but upon wholly different theories. Thus, if B agrees to buy certain goods from A, and to pay for the same, 
if .4. delivers the goods, and B fails to pay for the goods, B is clearly liable to it, as a matter of morality, but not 
because of his promise. His obligation is entirely independent of the promise, and would be equally binding if there 
were no promise. But if B refused to accept the goods when delivered, A, the vendor might hold B liable in 
damages for any loss sustained by reason of B breaking his promise to accept and pay for the goods. The theory of 
liability in this Latter situation is that B has breached his contract, not that B has received anything wifich 
entitled A to an equivalent amount.

Such Damages will usually be nominal, or at least bear little proportion to the value of the goods which the vendor 
sold. In other words, as we have seen, prior to the advent of Special Assumpsit A would have had no remedy at all 
where B refused to receive the goods, as a parol promise created no legal obligations, nor did it give the promisee 
a right of action for its breach. But prior to Special Assumpsit, under which the vendor could recover for his loss of 
a profit resulting from B’s breach, a purchaser could not take or receive another’s property without compensation 
therefor. Such acceptance of goods constituted a cau,sa debendi, upon which the Action of Debt might be 
sustained. 


(D Debt Not in General Available on a Broken Promise..—Debt, then, was applied to such cases on a theory 
not generally understood by the modern mind. To adapt the Ancient Real Action—the Writ of Right— to the 
recovery of a loan, sale or other Executed Contract, it was essential to first, estimate the amount owed as a 
specific sum of money, and second, to impute to the plaintiff a property in that pecuniary res~ by treating the sum 
owed as a specific piece of property in the hands of the debtor and which, by means of the force and effect of the 
so-called Executed Contract, had been transmitted to the ownership of the creditor, becoming his, by operation of 
law, the equivalent of the guid pro quo which the creditor had transferred to the debtor. And under this theory the 
law sometimes recognized such reciprocal transfer of title, even where there was no passing of a quid pro quo, as 
in the case where B bargained to buy a horse from A, the Court held that the property was in B, hence lie was 
entitled to bring Detlime, where A, the seller, was entitled to have a Writ of Debt for the price.“ 


44. Y.B. 20 Henry VI, 35 (1442). See, also, a statemont by Mr. Justice Holmes, in 1916, In the ease of 

In consequence of the foregoing, then, we may say that Debt lies upon what we now refer to as Simple 
(Executed) Contracts, upon any parol agreement which has been carried out by the plaintiff in such a manner as to 
transfer a quid pro quo, goods, labor, or money, to the defendant, so as to entitle the plaintiff to recover the 
corresponding price which is still in the hands of the defendant debtor. Says Professor Keigwin: “The efficient fact 
is the meritorious performance on the one side which—of itself and apart from the agreement—engenders the duty 
to make recompense for the benefit thereby imparted to the other side. The obligation enforced results from the facts 
accomplished by the plaintiff, and is founded upon the emolument inuring to the defendant from the transaction.” ~ 


(ID Debt Lies on the Simple (Executed) Contract, Assumpsit on the Promise.—What, then, was meant when 
it was said that Debt lies on the Contract, Assumpsit on the Promise? ° The distinction may be dearly perceived if 
we examine the case of Sands v. Trevelian,” decided in 1630. In that case .4 re11, 37 SOt. 3, 4, 61 LEd. 116, 118, In which 
he said: 

“When a man sells a horse, what he does from the point of view of the law is to transfer a right, and a right, being regarded 


by the law as a thing, even though a res inoorporalis, It is not illogical to apply the same rule to a debt that would be applied to a 
horse.”

46. “Mn Comyn’s Digest, written about 1740 and published in 1762 after the author’s death, It is laid down that ‘Debt lies upon every contract in 
deed or In law’; and the instance given to illustrate the doctrine is a use of the action to recover a statutory penalty, the unlawful 
act being the contract. So in 1677, in the Fourth Section of the Statute of Frauds, provision Is made concerning, not any contract for 
the sale of lands, but any contract or sale of lands, apparently distinguishing between an Executed Transaction and an 
Executory Agreement.” Keigwin, The Action of Debt, 11 Geo.L.J. 28, 37 (1923).

ACTION OF DEBT 
297 
quested B, an attorney at law, to defend his friend C, who had been sued, and A undertook to pay for the service 


rendered. B performed the service requested and C, having failed to pay, B demanded payment by A, and upon his 


Page 302 of 735 


refusal, sued A in Debt upon his undertaking. In the Court of Common Pleas it was held that Debt by B against A 
would not lie, but that Special Assumpsit would lie on A’s promise to B to pay the debt of C~ Special 


Assumpsit is the only remedy, the theory being that there was no quid pro quo passing from B to A, and 
hence no debt. 


From the result in the Sands case, two inferences may be drawn, first, that in the legal mind of the late Sixteenth 
and early Seventeenth Centuries, the word “contract” meant only a Simple (Executed) Contract, which covered 
factual situations, in which there had been an engagement to swap something of material benefit, the effect of which 
was an emolument moving from one party to the other, as in the instant case, from the attorney B, to his client C; 
second, a debt could not be created by a promise, where it was made to pay a debt chargeable to another other than 
the promisee. In the Sands case the only debt was that created by B’s performance of services to C, which per- 
forinance, by operation of law, imposed a legal duty upon C to pay B, which was remediable in Debt by B against A. 
No debt existed as between B mid A, and A had received no quid pro quo from B. As to A, then, no causa debendi 
in Debt existed; there was, however, an undertaking which did not involve any benefit to A, the promisor, 
but which did involve a breach of promise, remediable in Special Assumpsit, and for which the object of the action 
was the recovery of Damages and not a Specific Sum Certain, as required in Debt. 


It follows from the foregoing discussion that when there is what we now refer to as a Contract in the early 
Common-Law sense, 
there is a Simple (Executed) Contract which 


involves the performance of meritorious services by one party for the benefit of another. Even if there be a promise 
in such case, as there often may be, the Action of Debt which lies, is not grounded upon that promise; indeed, if only 
a promise existed, without the delivery of some benefit from the plaintiff to the defendant, Debt could not be 
sustained. 


(UD Debt and Special Assumpsit, While Sometimes Concurrent Remedies, are Grounded on Different 
Theories.—Jt was for this very reason that Special Assumpsit was, as we shall see later, developed as a remedy 
whereby a plaintiff might recover Damages for the breach of an express promise, as in the sale of goods, the 
loan of money, or the rendition of services of value to the defendant. Special Assumpsit may be concurrent with 
Debt, where over and above the Simple Executed Contract, performed on one side but not on the other, there is also 
an Express Promise to Pay, but, in general, the action lies in many factual situations wherein no debt exists. Where 
concurrent, it should be observed, that the theory upon which each action proceeds, is different. Debt lies upon the 
Contract, as conceived by the Common Law, long prior to the emergence of the Modern Contract as an incident of 
the development of Special Assumpsit, and under which the plaintiff seeks recovery of the equivalent of the benefit 
or quid pro quo which has passed to the defendant. In such case Debt proceeds independently of any promise to pay, 
and not upon any promise; Special Assumpsit proceeds upon the theory of the Breach of an Express Promise, and its 
occasional concurrence with Debt may be attributed to the presence of a Breach of an Express Promise over and 
above a Simple (Executed) Contract as known under the early Common Law. if a promise is essential to recovery 


Debt will not lie. This was made clear in Hersey v. Northern Assurance

Co. ahd in which the plaintiff sought to recover in two Common Counts in Indebitatus Assumpsit, which became a 
substitute for Debt, upon a fire insurance policy, under which the Insurance Company undertook to indemnify 
against loss by fire. The Court held that Debt or Indebitatus Assumpsit would not lie, as the Allegations of Fact, aside 
from the Express Promise to indemnify in case of loss by fire, were not sufficient to create a Common-Law Debt—a 
Debt created by a Simple (Executed) Contract. Said the Court: “In the present case the facts aside from the promise, 
via.: the plaintiff s ownership of the property, its destruction by fire without his fault—even the payment of the premi- 
uins,—do not raise an implied promise by the defendant to pay; it is only the fact that it promised, upon certain 
conditions, to pay, that makes it liable. Consequently, at Common Law, the promise, the conditions, and the 
fulfillment of the conditions, must be set forth—in other words the Count must be special.” ~ And the same rule 
applies in the case of a wager, a breach of warranty, or where the vendor fails to deliver the goods to the vendee.*° 


Page 303 of 735 


In all such cases, nothing of value having passed to the defendant, no debt has been created, or no causa det’endi 
making it his duty to pay; the remedy in such case is Special Assumpsit for the breach of an express promise.”

si. “But the distinction between Debt and Assumpsit is fundamental. For while Assumpsit might always be brought where Debt would lie 
upon a Simple Contract, the converse is not true. There were 


Executory Contracts 


WHERE a person promises to perform a certain act and then fails to perform, there is no basis for supporting an 
Action of Debt. There is no Simple (Executed) Contract, no Specialty Contract, no Judgment and no Statute. The only 
operative fact fixing liability of the contractor is his breach of promise. At Common Law, there were two reasons 
why a mere Breach of Promise would not support an Action of Debt. In the first place, at Common Law, the breach 
of a parol promise, while a lie, and hence immoral, was not regarded as a civil wrong, and therefore there was no 
remedy provided for breach of a parol promise; in short, the wrong was of such a character as to be not justiciable.

1588, the Action of Special Assumpsit, as a remedy for the Breach of Parol Promises, was created by extending the 
tort Action of Trespass on the Case Super Se Assumpsit into the Modem Field of Contract, thus fining the lacuna or 
gap which has been described as a deficiency in the Common Law Scheme of Remedial Justice.” But this de- 
velopment in no way affected the Nature or Scope of Debt. In the second place, Special Assumpsit, as the remedy 
for the Breach of a Promise, was not proprietary in character; the injury to the deceived promisee could not be 
treated, as in Debt, as a specific res, of either chattels or money, in the posmany cases where Assuinpslt was the only 
remedy. 

.Assumpsit would lie both where the plaintiff had incurred a detriment upon the faith of the defendant’s promise, and where the 

defendant bad received a benefit. Debt would lie only In the latter class of cases. in other words, Debt could be brought

session of the wrongdoer. If the promisordefendant. was to pay for his breach by making reparation in Damages, it 
had to be on some other theory than that which existed in Debt, as Debt could not be used as a remedy to recover 
Damages for a Breach of Contract, without destroying its character as a Real Action. 


(I) The Common Law Versus the Modern Law Meaning of the Term “Uontract”.—As previously suggested, 
at Common Law, when it was said that Debt lies on a Simple Contract, it was used to describe transactions not 
included within the term “Contract” as understood in Modern Law. Originally, it was used in a very narrow sense and to 
describe a Real Contract, under which the defendant was, by operation of law, placed under a duty to recompense 
the plaintiff in a sum equivalent in value to the quid pro quo received. The Specialty Contract, by way of 
contrast, was described as a Covenant, Grant or Obligation, but not as a Contract. As Professor James Barr Ames 
observes: “A Simple Contract Debt, as well as a Debt by Specialty, was originally conceived of, not as a Contract, in 
the Modern Sense of the Term, that is, as a Promise, but as a Grant. A bargain and sale and a loan were exchanges of 


Page 304 of 735 


values. The Action of Debt, as several writers have remarked, was a Real rather than a Personal Action. The Judgment 
was not for Damages, but for the recovery of a Debt, regarded as a i-es.” — 


Such a view of the Common-Law ConceptiOn of Contract excludes those factual situations where the 
defendant’s obligation is founded on a mere promise to perform, unaccompanied by the receipt of a quid pro 


~5- According to Bovier, Law Oietionary, p. 660, (3rd Rev. Phlladelphia, 1914) Real Contracts are those in which It is necessary that there 
be something more than mere conseifi, such as a loan of money, deposit or pledge, which from their nature require a delivery or the 
thing, v-es. 
so. Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Lecture XIV, Implied Assuznpslt /.~9, 151 (Cambrldge, 1913). 
quo. The word “Contract” meant an Executed Contract, under which a res passed from the plaintiff to the 
defendant. If the undertaking was executory, or dependent alone upon a promise, with provision for mutual 
exchange of benefit, Debt would not lie. Thus, cases involving suretyship or warranty, were not referred to as 
contract. And this explains why, as late as 1630, in the case of Sands v. Trevilian,” the Court held that a Contract 
of Guaranty was unenforceable in an Action of Debt, as the guarantor had received no quid pro quo from the 
promisee. In consequence, even unto this day, Debt will not lie for the mere Breach of a Promise, and this remains 
true even where the consideration itself creates an obligation to restore it if the promise be not performed, as where 
there is a payment on account for goods sold, and there is a failure of delivery. In such case the money paid 
constitutes a debt for which Debt will lie; ~ but any loss resulting from the failure of the sale is remediable only in 
Special Assumpsit for Damages, as opposed to Debt for a Sum Certain. And, of course, as previously observed, the 
exchange of Mutual Promises does not create a Contract upon which Debt will lie, as there is no quid pro quo 
passing to the defendant; there is, however, a Contract in the Modern Sense, upon the Breach of which Special 
Assumpsit will lie. 


(ID Debt Not Available Upon a Collateral Contratt.—The Common-Law Rule was that Debt would not lie 
upon a Collateral Promise to pay the Debt of Another,~°—a principle

established at an early period in the English Law. Thus, Reeves, in his History of English Law, °° commenting on 
the changes in legal proceedings between the time of William the Conqueror (1066—1087) and that of King John 
(1199—1216), declared: “When they (the parties) were both in Court, then it was to be considered how 
the demand arose. This might be of various kinds, as ex causa mutui, upon a borrowing; a causa 
venditionis, upon a sale; cx conimodato, upon a lending; cx deposito, upon a deposit; or by some other cause, by 
which a debt arose; for at this time all matters of Personal Contract were considered as binding only in the light of 
debts; and the only means of recovery, in a Court, was by this action of debt.” In each of these cases the 
common characteristic was that the consideration passed from the creditor to the debtor, so that the contract of the 
party receiving the guid pro quo, or benefit, was to pay his own debt and not that of another. Such transactions were 
in no way connected with third parties; the debtor was the party securing the benefit, lie alone owed the debt and 
Debt lay only against him. 


In view of this origin of the action, it is not surprising to find that Debt, as a remedy, 
had no application, in case of a Breach of Promise to pay money which was primarily due from a third party. In an 
early case, the law was stated as follows: 

“If C recover £10 against A, and B shall say to C that if he will release the £10 to A he will be his debtor, and 


accordingly the £10 are released to A, an Action of Debt will not lie against B, as this sounds in covenant.” ~ In

the subtle theory of the thy it was held 


same time undertook to pay for them at the day if A did not; if A should not pay for them, debt could not be brought against B, because 
it would sound In covenant.’” Beasley, C. 3., In Gregory v. Thompson, 31 N.J.L. 166, 168 (1865). 


~O. I Reeves, History of English Law, e. IV, 425 (Finlason’s .Ani.EL, Philadelphia 1880). 
that such a promise by B did not create a debt; the party originally liable, A, remained the debtor; B, who made 
himself a Surety did not by that act impose upon himself a debt. 


It thus appears that the existence of this ancient rule of law has never been denied, although Chief Justice 
Beasley, in Gregory 
v. Thompson, or suggests that in some instances it has been misapplied. He discusses the Anonymous” case, in 
which it was held that an Action of Debt brought by the payee of a Bill of Exchange against the acceptor, could not be 
supported, on the ground that the engagement was collateral. Chief Justice Beasley observes that while this decision 
has since been overruled in this country, it in no way affected the principal doctrine, as the reversal did not rest on 
grounds which involved the doctrine under elucidation. Chitty, a modern English authority, sustains the ancient 
doctrine, declaring: 
“Where a Simple Contract creates a Collateral Liability, as for the payment of the debt of a third person, Debt not 
being sustainable, Assumpsit is the only Form of Action.” ~ The same rule, Chief Justice Beasley observes, has 


found sanction in America in Pierce v. Crafts ~ and Willmarth v. Craw jord7 and the principle is not affected 
because the engagement sued upon has l~een expressed in an instrument under seal. This very issue was presented 
in 1838 in the case

of Randall V. Rigby,” in which Debt was brought upon an indenture whereby A had granted to B and C certain lands in 
fee simple, reserving to himself and his heirs forever an annual rent, and B and C had covenanted that they or one of 
them, or some one of their heirs, would pay the rent. The Declaration alleged that one of the stipulated installments 
of rent was unpaid. A brought Debt against C, and a Demurrer to the Declaration was sustained, the Court holding 
that Covenant under which the defendant C, jointly with another, had undertaken to secure the payment of 
an annuity issuing out of the land, was Collateral, and hence would not, support an Action of Debt.°° 
Finally Chief Justice Beasley refused to follow Mr. Justice Story’s suggestion in Bid lard v. Belt, - that it would 
not be overstraining the doctrine of Debt to apply it to Collateral Undertakings to pay a sum certain. 


(TM) A Single Quid Pro Quo Will Not Create Two Debts.—As previously observed, Debt was not available 
against a defendant if a benefit was conferred on a third person even though at the defendant’s request, as there was 
no quid pro quo essential to create a debt. As a result, however, of a case decided during the reign of Henry VI 
(1422— 1461),~° it was established that whatever would constitute a quid pro quo, if rendered to the defendant 
himself, would constitute a quid pro quo if delivered to a third person, provided it was delivered at the defendant’ s 
request, and that such third person did not become liable therefor to the plaintiff, as one guid pro quo could not give

(IV) The Statute of Frauds and the Rule that Debt Will Not Lie Upon a Collateral Promise.—The principle 
that Debt will not lie on a Collateral Promise to pay money primarily due from another is vital when it comes to the 
application of the Fourth Section of the Statute of Frauds,” which provided that no action shall be brought upon a 
promise to answer for the debt of another unless the agreement shall be in ~iting. The Statute would, of course, have 
no application except where the promise to pay the debt of another was Collateral and was not in Writing.” 


The Mode of Declaring on Simple Contracts 

WHERE the action is brought on a Simple Contract Debt, the Declaration must show the Consideration 
on which such Contract was founded with exactitude, and it must appear that there is a liability established 
either by law or by an express agreement of the defendant. The Form of the Statement should be that the 
defendant agreed to pay the debt, and not that he promised; the

basis of the action being the receipt of value and the duty arising from an 
Executed Consideration, and not, as in Special Assumpsit, from the promise.” 


The indebitatus Count in Debt differs from those in Indebitatus Assumpsit; for, although it states that 
the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in a named sum of money “for goods sold,” etc., precisely as in 
Indebitatus Assumpsit, and it is not necessary to set forth the nature or particulars of the transaction in detail, yet no 
promise should be stated, as in Assumpsit. The quantum meruit and quantum valebant Counts were formerly used 
in Debt, and resembled those in Assumpsit, except the words “agreed to pay” were used, instead of “promised to

DECLARATION IN DEBT—ESSENTIAL 
ALLEGATIONS: (3) IN DEBT 
ON A SPECIALTY 


140. Jn Debt on a Specialty, the deed or instrument relied upon must be stated in the 


Declaration in precise words, that is, verbatim, or according to its substance and legal effect. The 
Consideration need not be alleged, unless performance of it is a condition precedent. 


Page 307 of 735 


THE second variety of Debt was Debt on a Specialty, or upon an instrument under seal, which in the English law 
was known as a Formal Contract. It fixed an obligation in either one of two forms: (1) such an instrument might 
declare that an indebtedness is a presently existing fact; or (2) it might assure that a specified sum of money would 
be paid in the future. Regardless of whether the instrument took on a present or future aspect, 
if the obligation created was to render a specific, certain sum of money to the promisee or obligee, the Action of Debt 
lay to recover the specific res mentioned in the instrument, and as indicated by the instrument to be 
the property of the obligee to 
whom payment is thereby assured. As the implications of an instrument creating a Present Obligation under a Seal 
were different from those created by a Future Obligation under Seal, each will be considered separately. 


A Sealed Instrument Fixing a Present Obl~gation 


SEALED instruments creating a Present Obligation might take the form of a bond to pay a specific 
sum of money, as on a single or common money bond, without any condition, or they may take the form of 
a bond with a penalty or with a collateral condition. In each case the debt was created by the act of the parties to be 
charged in executing the instniment under seal which is the basis of the suit. Thus, where a bond is drawn in the 
conventional form and for the purpose of securing the payment of money, it purports and acknowledges that the 
obligor or the person who signs and seals the instrument is “to be held and firmly bound to the said” 
ohligee, or the said “plaintiff” in a specific and certain sum of money, which is to be paid to the said plaintiff 
(obligee), or his personal representatives at once or upon demand or at some fixed date or upon the happening of 
some contingent act or event. The phrase “to be held and firmly bound to the said plaintiff,” as it appears in the 
Declaration imports an obligation on the part of the obligor to render the specific thing—the indebtedness—to the 
obligee, and such language executed under seal amounts to a conclusive declaration by the person who thus 
acknowledges his indebtedness that he has in possession money which belongs to the obligee and which he ought to 
deliver to him. If the obligor fails to perform the duty to pay, as undertaken under seal, an 
Action of Debt on the bond lies to recover the money specified in the instrument, the theory 


being that the obligee or plaintiff is the owner of the specific sum designated and hence is 
75. MeGinnity v. Laguerenne, /0 DI. 101 (1848). 


Sec. 140

293 

merely seeking that which belongs to him as provided in the bond. And such an acknowledgment under seal of 
indebtedness by the obligor is conclusive, even where there was in fact no pre-existing debt, or 
where the debtor-obligor had no property which belonged to the obligee. The reason for this was that such an 
acknowledgment of indebtedness, when widened by the solemn act of seal, operated as an estoppel, at least in a 
Court of Law; and it had the practical effect of barring the obligor from denying what he had previously so solemnly 
admitted, thus placing the matter beyond dispute and eliminating any necessity of inquiry as to the nature and origin 
of the debt; and in short, under such an obligation, the issue as to how the debt arose, became immaterial. 


By reason of the peculiar characteristics of the sealed instrument creating a present obligation, it became possible 
for the obligee to use this form of instrument to obtain a benefit from the obligor which was clearly something other 
than the payment of a debt. Thus, suppose B, the obligor, executes a bond agreeing to pay the obligee, A, a 
certain sum of money. In effect the instrument becomes evidence of an absolute indebtedness. Now, suppose there is 
added to this instrument a condition in the form of a clause providing that the entire instrument should 
be void if the debtor-obligor, B, performs some other act, such as indemnif ying the obligee against certain 
contingencies, answering for the defaults of some third person, conducting himself in the proper and legal manner in 
some public office, paying a smaller sum of money, or performing a collateral contract. If the obligor, B, performs 
the condition set forth in the contract, the condition is said to have been fulfilled, with the result that 
there is nothing due on the bond; that is, the bond is void. If, however? the obligor, B, 
fails in any manner to meet the conditions as set forth, the bond is converted to an obligation 
as absolute in character as it was upon its original execution, with the result that the obligee, A, may sue in Debt to 
recover the sum specified in the bond as a conclusively acknowledged debt. 


Page 308 of 735 


In such an instance, what the bonl secured was not the sum certain as a debt, but an agreed penalty or Liquidated 
Damages for ~~tilure to do someting other than paying the debt. Thus, it becomes apparent that the obligor’s 
acknowledgment of an obligation to pay a specific sum, was, in reality “a cloak to disguise a collateral undertaking; 
and when the obligee sues on the bond for the amount therein acknowledged to be due, what he actually goes for is 
not a debt but Damages for the nonperformance of the contract contained in the condition.” - And under the 
Common Law, as the Breach of a Condition operated to convert the indebtedness into the absolute obligation it 
purported to be, the obligee, A, recovered the full amount prescribed by the bond, in total disregard as to the 
circumstances under which or the reason why the obligor failed to perform or the extent of the damage 
suffered by the obligee A, which, in some instances, was outrageously small. Thus, to illustrate, suppose 
B, the obligor, by bond, acknowledges an indebtedness to A, the obligee, of $10,000, with a condition that the bond 
is to be void upon the payment of $5,000 on a day certain. If, for any reason whatsoever, B failed to pay on the 
specified date, the larger amount became 
absolutely due. And, if thereafter, the obligor offered to pay the smaller sum, the amount, let us say, actually owed, his 
tender was of no avail.

ture time, such as to build a house, the promisee cannot sue the obligor upon any predicate 
of prior indebtedness; in such a case Covenant to recover Damages for the breach of the sealed 
instrument is the appropriate remedy, as Debt does not lie for an obligation originating in that manner. If, however, the 
sealed instrument had provided for the payment in the future of a specified sum of money, there is a suggestion of a 
pre-existing duty, the money promised presumably being in discharge of a present debt, as for a loan or for goods, 
which constitute a causa debendi.” By the mediaeval mind, such a promise was conceived of and treated as a 
present Grant of the specified sum, or a transfer of the title to the plaintiff obligee, which created a debt in the 
present, but a debt which was to be paid in the future. In other words, B’s agreement to pay A a specific sum of 
money next year, makes A the owner of that sum at once, even though A may make no claim of the property until the 
day specified. Thus, in the Early Law, it was thought that an Agreement by Specialty for the payment of money on a 
Future Day, in effect, operated as an immediate transfer of title to the sum mentioned, whereby the plaintiffobligee 
was authorized, upon the arrival of the date specified, or the event designated, to demand the specified sum as his 
own. Debt on Specialty, therefore, is the proper remedy to recover a certain and fixed sum of money, made payable 
by a sealed instrument, and which under the language of the engagement, is not something other than the debt of the 
obligor. As Professor Keigwin so truly observes: “When, therefore, Action was brought upon a Specialty obligating 
the defendant to a future payment, the plaintiff did not sue to enforce performance of an Executory Engagement, but 
to recover a specific sum to which the title had become vest

ed in him; he sought, not Damages for breach of an Executory Promise, but possession of an identical res, demanded 
as the proper object of a Real Action, one which had been made his property by an Antecedent Grant.” 7s 


The Mode of Declaring in Debt on Specialties 

IN Debt on Sealed Instruments the Declaration usually states the Execution of the Specialty, and makes Profert of 
it, ° without any mention of the Consideration on which the Contract was founded. It is necessary, however, where 
performance of the Consideration by the plaintiff is a Condition Precedent to his right to sue, to allege Fulfillment of 
the Conditions to defendant’s liability.” The Statement of the Specialty must be a correct description of it, as to time, 
parties, etc.; mid it must appear, either by Express Allegation or by the use of descriptive words importing the fact, 
that it was under seal.*! If not set out verbatim, it must be stated according to its legal operation awl effect.” It must

was by deed, and it is a general rule, as we shall hereafter see, that Prof ert of the deed must be made, unless it is in 
possession of the adverse party or lost or destroyed.*? 


In an Action upon a Penal Bond, it was formerly the practice for plaintiff to set out only the defendant’s 
obligation to pay the penalty, without mentioning the Condition Subsequent which it was the object of the bond to 
enforce. The defendant, if he thought 
he was able to prove performance of the Condition, would then crave Oycr of the Conclition and Plead Pert onnance, 
and the plaintiff would Reply, Assigning Breaches of the Condition.** Upon a Penal Bond the Real Cause of Action 
is the Breach of the Condition Subsequent. It is in effect a Covenant to Perform the Condition of the Bond. The Ac- 
tion is only in Form for a Debt, which is recited by way of penalty, and in reality is an Action for Damages for 
Breach of Contract. Contrary to the situation at Common Law, described above, where the fuJi penal sum was 
always obtained if the defendant had failed to perform the condition, now only the Actual Damages can be collected. 


By statute the plaintiff is usually required to Assign the Breaches Complained of in his Declaration, and the 
defendant may then meet them in his Pleas. Although Judgment may still be entered for the penalty of the bond, this 
stands merely as security for the Damages caused by the Breach of Condition as found by the Jury.*°

belongs to a certain person shall become the property of another; or the effect of such a statute is to create in the 
latter of these two persons a title to the thing transferred, and to cast upon the former of these two persons a legal 
obligation to surrender it to the other.*° For example, a statute may provide as a penalty f or engaging in prohibited 
fishing, hunting or smuggling, that the offender shall forfeit the instruments used in committing the wrongful act, 
such as a boat, fishing equipment, horse, weapon or other materials used in the process of violating the revenue 
laws. Such statutes customarily provide that the Forfeited Articles shall pass to the informer, to the officer detecting 
the offence, or to the Government,.-.--the effect of such provision being to transfer to such person the title to the 
property in question. Upon the violation of this type of statute, the property of the offender is held without any 
further right in the offender, but as ‘the property of the person to whose benefit it accrues under the terms of the 
statute. The same rule applies where the statute provides for the Forfeiture of a certain sum of money, the pecuniary 
amount as a penalty being assimilated to a corporeal chattel, the title to which, by force of the statute, has passed 
from the wrongdoer to the person designated to take under the Statute. The aggrieved person, whether a Private 
Informer, or a Government officer, in suing on such a penalty, acts on the theory that he owes the money or other 
thing Forfeited, which the offender is obligated to surrender to its new proprietor, the statute constituting a cau.sa 
debendi.°°

injury, as for waste, extortion, etc., and the Damages are ascertained by the act, and are not uncertain, Debt will lie 
to recover them, if the statute prescribes no other remedy.” 


Where, however, the statute giving the right to sue for a penalty, or other debt created by it, prescribes a specific 
remedy for its recovery, other than Debt, the Action of Debt will not lie; the form of action provided is then regarded 
as the exclusive remedy.™*

The Mode of Declaring in Debt Upon Statutes 


IN Debt on a Statute at the suit of the party aggrieved, or by a Common Informer, the statement should embrace 
all the material facts to show that the offence or act charged against the defendant was within its provisions. All 
circumstances necessary to support the action must be alleged, but it is sufficient if these be substantially set forth, 
and the precise words of the statute need not be used.°° If there is an Exception or Proviso incorporated in the 
Enacting Clause of the statute and part of it, the plaintiff must show that the defendant is not within the Exception; 
but, if the Exception is contained in a Subsequent Clause, it is a matter of Defense only.”” In Framing the 
Declaration, it is necessary to include the words, “against the form of the statute” or “contrary to the form of the 
statute”, or “statutes,” in order to show, on the face of the Record, that the Action is Founded on the Statute.”

DECLARATION IN DEBT—ESSENTIAL AL 
LEGATIONS: (5) IN DEBT ON A JUDGMENT 


Gl 


142. In Debt on a Judgment, where the Action is based on a Judgment obtained in a Court of Record, no statement 
of the cause of action on which the Record was founded is necessary; the statement should consist of a Description of 


the Judgment, which may be in a concise form, and need not state in full the previous proceedings in the Action in which it was 
obtained. 


In General 
IN a Court of Record, according to a “formulary of immemorial usage,” °- a Final Judgment declares that “it is 


considered that the plaintiff do have and recover of the defendant” a certain sum of money or a specific chattel; that 
is, the Judgment merely determines the matter of right between the parties, under which the plaintiff is to regain 


Page 312 of 735 


something which already belongs to him and which is wrongfully possessed by the defendant. What the language of 
the Judgment imports, and what the Judgment does, is to establish the plaintiff’s title to a specific chattel or to a 
certain sum of money. In like manner, a Recognizance, whereby one person enters upon the records of a court an 
acknowledgment of his indebtedness to another, is treated as creating a legal obligation on the part of the defendant 
to pay the debt admitted to be due. And so, in any case where the indebtedness is demonstrated by a Record, the 
Action of Debt, because of its proprietary Character, was peculiarly appropriate as a remedy whereby the plaintiff 
could recover money manifested to be his property. 


Thus, a Judgment for a sum of money adjudged by the court to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff in any 
Former Action, is a Debt of Record; that is, a sum of

money which is adjudged to be due by a Judgment of a Court of Record. This is an obligation of the highest nature, 
being established by the adjudication of a Court of Record. An Action of Debt was the only means for the 
enforcement of a Judgment after a Year and a Day had elapsed from the time of its recovery. Alter such time 
Execution could not issue thereon, as the Judgment was presumed to be satisfied. So that, if one has once obtained a 
Judgment against another ‘for a certain sum, and neglects to take out Execution thereupon, he may afterwards bring 
an Action of Debt upon this Judgment, ‘and shall not be put upon.the Proof of the Original Cause of Action; but, 
upon showing the Judgment once obtained, still in force, and yet unsatisfied, he is entitled to a New Judgment for 
the debt. 


Debt thus lies on any obligation of Record 
to pay money.” It lies, for instance, on a 
Domestic Judgment of a Court of Record, 
and on the Judgment of a Court of Record of 
a sister state, which is generaly regarded as 
a Specialty.' Debt will lie on a Judgment of

Debts Upon Recognizance 


THESE debts involve a sum of money, recognized or acknowledged to be due to the state or to an individual, in 
the presence of some Court or Magistrate, with a Condition that such acknowledgment shall be void upon the 


Page 313 of 735 


appearance of the party in a criminal proceeding, his good behavior, or the like; and these, if Forfeited upon 
Nonperformance of the Condition, are also ranked among this principal class of debts, viz., Debts of Record, since 
the contract on which they are founded is witnessed by the highest kind of evidence, viz, by Matter of Judicial 
Record.’

The Recognizance Is equivalent to a Judgment; aothing remains to be done but Execution. Within a year from the date feted for payment, a Writ 
of Execution will issue as a matter of course, on the creditor applying for it, unless the debtor, having discharged his duty, has procured the 
cancellation of the entry which described the confession. The Recognizance was formerly in more common Use than now, and large sums of 
money were lent upon its security,

founded is necessary.’ The Statement should consist of a Description of the Judgment, which may be in a concise 
form, and need not state in full the previous proceedings in the action in which it was obtained.” The particular form 
which should be used may be a brief statement, that at a certain time and in a certain Court of a given County and 
State, an action was duly brought, and that in such action a Judgment was duly rendered in favor of the plaintiff 
therein for a certain sum; and, while it has been held unnecessary to allege that such Judgment is still in force, it 
would seem the better practice to do so.’ If the Judgment sued on is a domestic one, rendered by a Court of the State 
in which it is sought to be enforced, and by a Court of Record, it is not essential to allege that such Court had 
jurisdiction, the statement that it was a Court of Record being sufficient; but if rendered by an Inferior Court, as that 
of a Justice of the Peace, it should be Averred that the Court had Jurisdiction, both of the parties and the subject 
matter. Where the Judgment is a Foreign One, rendered in a Court of a Foreign Country, the Allegation of such 
Jurisdiction is always necessary, but not where Judgment is rendered by a Court of General Jurisdiction in a sister

OF COURT 


143. the basis of the Action of Debt generally exists today as it did at the Common Law, but it is now brought 
under the Single, Formless Form of Action as prescribed by Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court. 


THE Status of the Action of Debt under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court may be made clear by 
reference to a few cases. Within four years after the Code of Procedure was adopted in 1848, the issue was presented 


Page 314 of 735 


in Allen c~ Carpenter v. Patterson,'° in an Action which, under the Code was equivalent to either an Action of Debt 
or Indebitatus Assumpsit, in which the plaintiff brought suit for goods sold and delivered, under the Code Provision 
that the Complaint should contain a plain and concise statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, alleging 
that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of $371.01 for goods sold, and that there “is now due 
them from the defendant” the said sum for which they demand Judgment, &c. The defendant Demurred on the 
ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action in that the Allegation that “there is now due,” did not 
amount to a statement that the debt had become payable, or that it meant no more than the statement that the 
defendant is “indebted.” In affirming the Judgment for the plaintiffs, the Court of Appeals declared that it was re- 
quired to treat the term “due” as having been used in the Complaint to express the fact

that the money sought to he recovered had become payable. The Court declared: 


“The Code requires that a Complaint shall contain a plain and concise statement of the facts constituting the Cause 
of Action (§ 142). Every fact which the plaintiff must prove to enable him to maintain his suit, and which the 
defendant has a right to controvert in his answer, must be distinctly averred or stated. This rule of pleading in an 
action for a legal remedy is the same as formerly in this, that facts and not the evidence of facts must be pleaded (1 
Chitty FI. 215; Read v. Brookman, 3 Term, 159, per BULLER, J.; Eno v. Woodworth, 4 Com. 249). «+ 

“The counsel for the defendant insisted that the statement that there is “due,” &c., did not amount to a statement 
that the debt had become payable; that it meant no more than the statement that the defendant is “indebted,” &c., and 
that if the word “due” had two significations, the pleader could not select between them, and impute to it the one 
which suits his purpose best; for the maxim was that everything should be taken most strongly against the pleader, 
or if the meaning of the words be equivocal and two meanings present themselves, that construction shall be adopted 
which is most unfavorable to the party pleading. In the case of United States v. State Bank of North Carolina (6 Pet. 
29), Judge Story said that the term “due” was sometimes used to express the mere state of indebtment, and then it 
was an equivalent to owed or owing, and it was sometimes used to express the fact that the debt had become payable. 
In the latter sense, I think that the word “due” was used by the pleader in the complaint in this suit, and in that sense 
it may be deemed to have been used.” 


Five years later, in 1857, in the famous case of McKyring v. Bull,” the status of the

12.16 New York 297, 69 Am.Dee. 000 (1857). 

Action of Debt or its substitute, the Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit, came up again. The plaintiff brought an action 
under the Code, equivalent at Common Law, to an Action of Debt or Indebitatus Assumpsit, in which he alleged that, 
as an employee of the defendant, he had performed certain labor and service, which were the sum of ~650, and 
concluded as follows: “There is now due to this plaintiff, over and above all payments and offsets, on account of 
said work, the sum of one hundred and thirty-four dollars, which said sum defendant refuses to pay; wherefore 
plaintiff demands Judgment in tins action” &c. The defendant pleaded a General Denial. At the Trial the defendant 
offered evidence of payment as a Defense to the Action, which was objected to and excluded on the ground that it 
should have been pleaded. The Jury found a Verdict for the plaintiff, upon which Judgment was entered. The de- 
fendant, having made out a Bill of Exceptions, the Judgment on Appeal was affirmed by the Superior Court at 
General Term. In affirming the Judgment, the Court of Appeals, speaking through Selden J., declared: 


“Although the Code of Procedure has abrogated the Common-Law System of Pleading, with all of its technical 


tules, yet, in one respect, the new system which it has introduced bears a close analogy to that for which it has been 
substituted. The general denial allowed by the Code corresponds very nearly with the General Issue, in actions of 


Page 315 of 735 


Assumpsit and of Debt on Simple Contract, at Common Law. The decisions upon the subject, therefore, in the 
English courts, although not obligatory as precedents since the changes introduced by the Code, will nevertheless be 
found to throw much light upon the question presented here. 


“While the General Issue, both in Assumpsit and Debt, was, in theory, what the general denial allowed by the 
Code is in fact, viz., a simple traverse of the material allegations of the Declaration or Complaint, yet, 
Sec. 143 

ACTION OF DEBT 
301 

from the different phraseology adopted in the Two Forms of Action, a very different result was produced. The 
Declaration, in Debt, averred an existing indebtedness, and this amount was traversed by the plea of nil debet, in the 
present tense; hence, nothing could be excluded which tended to prove that there was no subsisting debt when the 
suit was commenced. In Assumpsit, on the contrary, both the averment in the Declaration and the traverse in the 
plea were in the past, instead of the present tense, and related to a time anterior to the commencement of the suit. 
Under non assumpsit, therefore, so long as the rule of pleading which excludes all proof not strictly within the 
issue was adhered to, no evidence could be received except such as would tend to show that the 
defendant never made the promise. That this was the view taken of these pleas, in the earlier cases, is clear.” 


Judge Selden observes, however, that contrary to this view in the earlier cases, a practice grew up for centuries 
under which evidence was received of payment, and other special defences under the plea of non assumpsit, as well 
as nil debet. But, he points out, this practice was swept away under the rules of Hilary term, adapted under the au- 
thority of the act of 3d and 4th William IV., ch. 42, § 1, under which the plea of nil debet was abrogated, and 
that of non assumpsit restored to its earlier status. And, guided by this fact, Judge Selden concludes: 


“My conclusion therefore is, that neither payment nor any other defence, which confesses 
and avoids the Cause of Action, can in any case be given in evidence as a defence, under an answer 
containing simply a General 
Denial of the Allegations of the Complaint.” 13 


Finally, we come to the case of Stinson v. Edgemoor Iron Works,” a 1944 Federal case

ie Ee ane of citizenship jurisdiction, and decided under the Delaware Law. The plaintiff alleged that he 
was employed by the defendant for one year from February 22, 1943, under a contractual arrangement reached on 
March 12, 1943, but retroactive to February 22, 1943, at an annual salary of $8,200; that the defendant 
breached the contract by wrongfully discharging the plaintiff on March 17, 1943, whereby he became 
entitled to damages in an amount representing the balance of his unpaid salary, the amount of which is $6,491.65. 
The defendant Moved to Dismiss the Complaint on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action. 
In denying the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, the United States District Court declared: 


“The Delaware System of Pleading and Practice is presently that which prevailed in England at the time of the 
separation of the Colonies. Whatever may have been the changes in the Action of Debt in other states, that Action in 
Delaware remains today as it was at Common Law in England even prior to the adoption of the Hilary Rules in 
1834. It is very clear that the Action of Debt as developed in England prior to the Hilary Rules of 1834 could not be 
used to recover Damages for breach of an employment contract. In such suits the amount of Damages—in 
accordance with the test set forth in the Delaware case of Ogden-Howard 
—is necessarily uncertain and unliquidated. The amount of such Damages can only be ascertained by Judgment of 
the Court or by Verdict of a Jury after the consideration of many factors. The Delaware authorities reassert 
the principle that an Action of Debt will not lie, unless the demand is for a sum certain, or for a pecuniary demand 
which can readily be reduced to certainty by computation. No Delaware case has been found which even hints that 
its Courts are disposed to deviate from the limitations of the Action of Debt as They 
existed in England at the time of the Revolution. Delaware inherited

from England the law relative to an Action of Debt, and that law remains in force until it is changed by 
the Delaware Courts or its Legislature. In fact, there have been no changes in the Delaware law 
relative to Actions of Debt, except in one instance. In 1933 the Legislature of the State of Delaware, 
Laws of Del., Vol. 38, Chap. 201, abolished the distinction between an Action of Covenant and one of Debt. But 
only to this limited extent has the original Action of Debt been changed from its formal status at Common 
Law and this was apparently found necessary by the enactment of a specific statute for this particular purpose. 


* * 


“Viewed against the Historical Development of the Action of Debt, it is apparent that Debt would not lie in 

Delaware to recover Damages or compensation for breach of an employment contract regardless of the Allegations 
in the Declaration. I consequently think it clear that Ogden-Howard Co. v. Brand, supra, merely held 
that an Action of Debt was not the proper Form of Action, and consequently there is no basis for defendant’s 
contention that there are additional holdings implicit in that decision. The precise problem before me is, therefore, 
the simple one of whether the Complaint filed in the instant case is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. I think it sufficient—especially, since the 
rules are to be construed to ‘secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.’ Here, the plain- 
tiff, after stating the existence of a contract 
of employment and a discharge without cause by the defendant-employer, alleges: 
'8. By reason of Defendant’s said breach of its contract with Plaintiff, Plaintiff is en- 
titled to Damages from Defendant in an amount representing the balance of Plaintiff's unpaid salary under 
his said contract with Defendant, the amount of which is the sum of $6,491.65 +. I think this is a perfectly adequate 
and clear allegation and one that satisfies the requirement of Rule 8.” ~s 


15. Stinson v. Edgenloor Iron Works, Inc., 53 F.Supp. 
864, 867, 868 (1944). 


In the case of Williamson v. Columbia Gas and Electric Corporation, 110 F (2cl) 15, decided in 1939 the Circuit Court of Appeals took notice of 
the formal view of Delaware on the Action of Debt, as applied to the Delaware statute of Limitations. Chief Justice Maria declared: 
‘In order to apply a statute of Limitations, such as that of Delaware, which reads in terms of Common Law Actions, to a Civil Action brought in a 


District Court, it is necessary for the Court through a consideration of the nature of the Cause of Action disclosed in the Complaint to 
determine the Form of Action which would have been brought upon it at common Law. It is evident that the complaint in the ease before us 
discloses a Cause of Action which, under the Common Law of Delaware, would be enforceable in an kction on the Case and not in an Action 
of Debt on a Specialty. The District Court, therefore, properly held that the action was barred by the Delaware Statute of Limitations?’ 

And this was the view taken despite the plaintiff's contention that since the “Civil Action” provided for by the Federal Rules of civil Procedure, 
28 U.S.C.A. following Section 723c, had abolished all distinctions in the Forms of Action, the State Statutes of Limitations based upon 
differences in Forms of Action no longer apply. 


For a similar unavailing contention under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act of 1783, see Gibbs v. Guild. [18821 9 O.B.D. 59, 67.

tie conventione—is a remedy for the recovery of Damages for the Breach of a Sealed Contract, According to Street, 
“This remedy is the exact analogue of (Special) Assumpsit, the only difference between the two 
actions, being that the latter lies for the Breach of a Simple Promise, while Covenant is maintainable only upon a 
Specialty.” ~ 


The Action of Covenant lies for the Breach of a Contract under Seal, executed by the defendant; and at Common 
Law it will lie in no other case. If the Specialty has been materially varied or modified by a subsequent informal 
agreement, the remedy is in Assumpsit.*

the purchase money, but if the Contract is Signed and Sealed by the Vendor only, and merely delivered to and 
accepted by the Ven~ dee, the Vendor cannot maintain Covenant against the Vendee on what purports in the 
instrument to be a Covenant by the latter to pay the purchase money. The Action must be Assumpsit, or perhaps 
Debt.” 


The Action of Covenant could not be employed for the recovery of a debt, even though the 
existence of the debt is attested by a Bond or Sealed Instrument. “The Law is economical; the fact 
that a man has one action is a reason for not giving him another.” ° Covenant came, however, to be permitted in the 
case of a Sealed Debt, where there was an Express Covenant to pay the Debt, or where there were words that could 
be construed as such.’ 


Whenever the defendant has executed and delivered a Contract under Seal, and has broken it, Covenant is the 
proper remedy.®

The Action is proper to recover damages for Breach of a Covenant of Warranty, or of seisin, or against ineumbrances, or for quiet enjoyment,

Whether or not a Covenant will be implied is a question of Substantive Law, and has nothing to do with the Porm of Action, or any question of 
pleading. Whether the Covenant is Express or Impiiod, the Method of Pleading is the same. Grannis v. Clark, 8 Cow. (N.Y.) 36 (1827), 


10. Illustrations of C venants for something in praescnti are found in Covenants against incumbrances contained in a deed of land, Jones v. Warn- 
er, 81 Ill. 343 (1876); or Covenants of Seisin, Brady v. Spurck, 27 III. 478 (1861). These are really Can-tracts of Indemnity against loss by 
defects of title. 


A Covenant of quiet enjoyment is an illustration of a Covenant for cometbing in the future. Srndy v. Spurek, 27 Ill. 478 (1861). And any promise 
under seal, whether to pay money, or to do some other act, or to forbear from doing some act, is such a Covenant, 


liquidated, so that Debt will lie, the plaintiff may nevertheless bring Covenant instead, for the remedies are 
concurrent; but if the sum, the payment of which is secured by a Writing under Seal, is unllquidated and uncertain 
in amount, Covenant is the only remedy for its recovery.” Indeed, since Assumpsit will not lie for Breach of a 
Contract under Seal, it follows that Covenant is the only remedy to recover unliquidated Damages for the Breach o.f 
a Contract under Seal. 


COVENANT-.-DISTINGUJSIJED FROM AND CONCURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 


145. Covenant may be distinguished from Debt, as it lies only on an instrument under Seal, whereas Debt lies 
upon a Statute, a Record, a Simple Contract and on a Specialty. Where the Damages are liquidated upon Breach of a 
Sealed instrument, Debt and Covenant are concurrent remedies; but where the Damages are unliquidated only 
Covenant will lie. Special Assumpsit and Covenant are in no instance concurrent, but Covenant and Case are as 
against a tenant for yeas’s who committed Waste. 


THE Action of Covenant is distinguishable from Debt in that it lies only on a sealed instrument, whereas Debt 
lies upon a Statute, a Record, and a Simple Contract, as well as a Specialty. Covenant may be brought for the 
payment of uncertain as well as certain sums of money, and for the non-performance of Covenants to do or not to do 
any other lawful thing. As we have seen, Covenant and Debt became concurrent remedies on all Sealed Instruments 
upon the Breach of which the Damages were liquithted.

OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS

Special Assumpsit and Covenant were in no instance concurrent, as the former action was the 
remedy for the Breach of an Unsealed or Simple, Express Promise, whereas the latter action was the remedy for 
Breach of a Sealed Promise," along with Debt on a Specialty. In this connection, it should be remembered that 
Covenant, as a remedy ona Sealed Instrument, gave the plaintiff a remedy of a higher nature 
than Special Assumpsit.”* 


Covenant and Case in the Nature of Waste were concurrent remedies. Thus, in Kinlyside v. Thornton, 4 an 
Action on the Case in the Nature of Waste was permitted even though it was clear there was a Covenant not to 
commit waste. Chief Justice De Grey declared: “1 have no difficulty upon this question. The tenant for years 
Commits waste and delivers up the place wasted to the landlord. Had there been no deed of Covenant, the Action of 
Waste or Case in the Nature of Waste would have lain. Because the landlord by the Special Covenant acquires a new 
remedy, does he therefore lose his old? “'s 


As the sole and exclusive remedy on Sealed Instruments for the payment of an uncertain sum of 
money, or for the performance or non-performance of other things, according to Browne,’° it was generally required 
that the defendant have executed the Covenant under Seal; but it was not usually essential that the plaintiff should 
have executed it, as a Covenantor, having executed the contract, was chargeable on his Covenant, even

of the Action, and must be laid high enough to cover the actual demand. 


THE amount recoverable in this action is the Damage Caused by the Breach, and the Damages may either depend

STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS, AND RULES 
OF COURT 


153. In a majority of the states the effectiveness of the seal has been abolished or substantially modified by 
Statute. 

in a jurisdiction where the seal has retained its effectiveness, and the Code has been adopted, there is some 
authority to the effect that where the action of Covenant was the proper action at Common Law, the allegations in an 
action under the Code must be such as would have supported the Common Law action of Covenant. 


IN a majority of the states, the effectiveness of the private seal has been abolished or substantially modified by 
Statute.” The change in effectiveness of the seal raises questions in pleading which, although not related to the Codes, 
are nevertheless of considerable importance in Modern Practice, For example, in Rondot v. Rogers)? the Michigan 
Court held that the purpose of a Michigan Statute which provided that no deed was to be deemed invalid for want of 
a seal, “was to permit parties intending to make a deed or specialty to have the writing signed by them, though 
without a seal, treated in law as a deed or specialty; and therefore that covenant might be maintained thereon.”

ACTION OF COVENANT 


On the other hand, in Allied Amusement 


v. Glover,,” the Hawaii Court) after pointing out that seals had lost their significance in Hawaii, concluded 
as follows: “In this jurisdiction, therefore, assumpsit rather than covenant lies for recovery of damages in 
breach of a contract whether it be under or not under seal.” 


In a jurisdiction where the seal has retained its effectiveness, and the Code has been adopted, 
there is some authority to the effect that where the action of Covenant was the proper action at Common Law, 
the allegations in an action under the Code must be such as would have supported the Common Law Action of 


Covenant. The New Jersey Court addressed itself to this point in Katin v. Crispe7,~’ as follows: “At common 
law, a defendant having entered into an agreement in writing under seal, a breach thereof and resulting damages 
gave rise to an action styled ‘covenant’. It was the pe

culiar remedy for the non-performance of a contract under seal, where the damages were unliquidated and 
depended in amount upon the opinion of the jury. Chitty on Pleading, page 118. 


“The plaintiffs contend that the format of their action is proper. Under the formulating system of pleading at 
common law, their action would be styled ‘covenant’. Prior to the Practice Act of 1912, two principal categories of 
actions were provided in personal actions, 1, actions upon contract, and 2, actions ex delicto. The act of the 
Legislature in 1912, Chapter 231, paragraph 3, N.J.S.A. 2:27—7, re-styled the names of actions at law by providing 
that there should be one form of civil actions in the courts of law, denominated ‘action at law’. The change 
abrogated the names of the former classifications, but it did not destroy the value of classification nor eliminate the 
averments requisite to a good count or the facts to be proved in support of them. Ward

SCOPE OF THE ACTION 


154. The action of account lies where one has received goods or money for another in a fiduciary capacity, to 
ascertain and recover the balance due. It can only be maintained where there is such a relationship between the 
parties, as to raise an obligation to account, and where the amount due is uncertain and Un-liquidated. 


WHERE one has received property belonging to another, to invest or use on his behalf,

from the receipt of something. Agents charged with handling for profit money or goods, or collecting rents and 
profits from another’s land, such as Bailiffs, Partners, Factors, Commission Merchants, Executors, Trustees, and 
Guardians, come under a legal obligation to render an account of the capital (corpus) and proceeds which they 
receive on behalf of their principal. The Obligation to Account is thus one which the law imposes 


independently of contract. It is not founded on promise, but on the existence of a relationship of fact, namely, the 
being intrusted with the handling of property belonging to another. 


This obligation was recognized by the Ancient Common Law and was enforced by the Action of Account. Owing 
to defects of legal procedure, this action was later superseded by the Action for Money Had and Received and by 


Bill in Equity. In the Action of Account the amount of money claimed is uncertain and unliquidated, but by an ac- 
counting before Auditors the balance due is ascertained and declared by the Judgment of the Court as a Debt. 


Account is the proper form of action when one has received money or property for the useof 
another for which he should account to the latter,’ or where two persons are partners in a mercantile adventure.~ 


“It is said of this action that it is one of antiquity, and lies at Common Law against Guardians, Bailiffs, Receivers, 
and Mercantile Copart

another wherein both were named merchants; that is to say, against all who had charge or possession of the lands, 
goods, chattels, or moneys of another with a liability to render an account thereof, such as Partners, Trustees,

Common Law the action could be maintained between Mercantile Partners where there were two of them only, and 
not when the firm consisted of more than two.” But in most states where the action is in use this has been changed by 
statutes.° Indeed, in many respects the scope of this action has been very much extended by statute, both in

The action will only lie where the amount 
sought to be recovered is uncertain and unliquidated." If the mutual debits and credits of the parties have been 
ascertained, or an account has been stated between them, Assumpsit or Debt, and not Account, is the proper remedy 
to recover the definite balance due.'” In some cases Assumpsit or Covenant 


may be Concurrent Remedies with this Form of Action; but Debt can never be so, for 
account will never lie where the object of the suit is the recovery of a sum certain. 


The Action of Account-Render differs from the other Common-Law Actions in the Mode of Procedure. Though 
it is Commenced like them, the Judgment is first rendered upon the liability to account, guod computet, which 
is an Interlocutory Judgment only." The Court thereupon appoints Auditors or Arbitrators, whose business it is to 
take and report the account between the parties, with the balance due, and upon their report 
the 
Final Judgment is rendered. If the balance was found in favor of the defendant, no Judgment for it could be 


given him at Common Law. In Pennsylvania the jury might 


Page 327 of 735 


settle the accounts in the first instance, and then Final Judgment only was rendered; but, where this could not be 
done, the practice was as above indicated. In Illinois and some other states the Jury merely determined tha 
liability to account, and heard no evidence as to the state of the accounts; that being

ACCOUNT—DISTINGUISHED PROM AND 
CONCURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 


155. The Action of Account should be distinguished from an Action for an Accounting, which was Equitable in 
character, and from the Action on an Account, which might be in Debt or Indebitatus Assurnpsit. It is concurrent in 
certain situations with Debt, Detinue, Indebitatus Assumpsit, and a Bill for an Equitable Accounting. 


THE Action of Account, at Common Law, was available against a Bailiff, Guardian or Receiver, or any person 
who received money or other goods to be used for another’s benefit and in due time accounted for.” As the Action 
of Debt finally developed, it became a Concurrent Remedy with Account, and as Indebitatus Assumpsit was a 
Substitute for Debt in the Field of Debt on Simple Contract, it also became a Con- 


14- Per a ease in which the procedure in an Action of Account is shown in all its technicality, see Willson v. Willson, 5 NIL. 791 (1820), in wluch 
Kilpatriek, C. J., observes: “This is a Writ of Error to Gloucester Pleas, In an Action of Account. This Form of Action, is, in itself, very 
difficult, dilatory, and expensive; it has long since fallen into disuse, in a great measure, in England; amid in New Jersey, I have never known, 
or heard of, more than two or three eases, either in my own time, or before; and I doubt whether even they were carried through 


to Finni Judgmeat. Hence, we have but few precedents to guide us in a suit of this kind, and these few, of pretty ancient date; not very 
intelligible, nnd still less applicable, at this day. In most in-stances, therefore, the Action on the Case, which is simple, easy and well 
understood, has taken the place of this, in the Common Law Courts, and when 


that did not afford a complete remedy, resort has been had to Equity, where confidential concerns and trusts of this kind, are more 
properly cognEzable. Still, however, like all other actions, It is open to all; and In some cases, where the expense of a Court of Chancery 
would be too heavy for the subject-matter, as It must be confessed, under Its present establishment, it frequently woul4 be, It may, also 
be necessary.” 
current Remedy with Account.'° And in the field of Bailments Detinue and Account became Concurrent Remedies 
for the Bailor. 


To avoid the delay incident to the Action of Account and to keep the business of accounting in mercantile matters 
within the jurisdiction of the Common Law Courts, where there was an express promise to account, an Action of 
Trespass on the Case on promises, for the refusal to account, was sanctioned.” And, as a matter of principle it 
was urged that Case would also lie where the obligation to account was raised by operation of law.'* Martin states 
that it has been doubted whether the law raises an implied promise on the part of an agent or factor to account,’° but 
feels there is no sufficient reason against it.20 


When the action fell into disuse, its function was largely taken over by the Equitable Bill for an Accounting, the 
Court of Equity affording a more flexible machinery for the handling of Complicated accounts, in the Form of 


Discovery before a Master, who possessed power to examine the Witnesses under Oath, to compel the production of 
books and documents, to pass upon disputed

money of another were compelled to render such account. 1 C. J. 602, ~ 71. The petition in an Action of Account is required to set out a 
relationship of the parties and a state of facts that would entitle the claimant to an accounting; allege that no accounting had been made; and

DECLARATION IN ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNT RENDER—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: 
(1) INGENERAL 


157. The Essential Allegations of the Declaration in Account or Account Render are: 
(I) A statement of the facts showing a legal relation between plaintiff and defendant which gives rise to 
the tight to an accounting. 
(ID) The refusal of defendant to account. (III) The Damages.

RENDER—ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: 
(2) A STATEMENT OF THE FACTS 
SHOWING A LEGAL RELATION BETWEEN PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT 
WHICH GIVES RISE TO THE RIGHT TO 
AN ACCOUNTING 


158. The Declaration must allege privity between the plaintiff and defendant, the plaintiff’s property, the 
manner in which the defendant received it, and the special character in which the defendant is charged. If 


Page 330 of 735 


several are macic defendants, the averment mus he of a joint liability only. In some cases it must be shown from 
whose hands the defendant received the money. 


AS the object of the Action of Account or Account-Render is to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff s claim, it 
is unnecessary that the sum should be accurately stated; and it is sufficient, as to time, that the defendant be 
charged as receiving the money or property between certain dates. To sustain the action privity or relationship 
between the parties is essential, and such privity must therefore be alleged.~* And the particular 


23. The meaning of the term “privity” as givea in tin, authorities is somewhat confusing, and the division of it into several classes is not much 
better. Probably the best definition Is that It Is a fiduciary ac-

OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS

character or capacity in which the defendant acted and is chargeable must also be stated, as the proof must, in 
every case, correspond with the plaintiff's Allegations.” It seems necessary, where the action is against a receiver of 
money, to show from whom he received it, in order that he may be prepared to meet the charge against him; 25 and 
in Actions Between Tenants in Common, under the Statute of Anne,”° as well as in actions between partners, it is 
necessary to aver that the money was received for the common benefit of the plaintiff and defendant, and that the 
defendant has received more than his share of the profits?’

(3) THE REFUSAL TO ACCOUNT OR

159. The Declaration must also allege a neglect or refusal of the defendant to account. A demand is 
unnecessary. 


FROM what has been stated, it is obvious that the breach or infraction of the plaintiff’s right here is the neglect or 
refusal of the defendant to account as to the matters in question, and the Allegation need be only a formal one to that 
effect. A special demand

160. The amount claimed to be due should also he stated, but the recovery may exceed the sum alleged. 


AS it is the object of the action to recover an uncertain sum or quantity claimed to be due, the Declaration 
should state the amount of the demand in the Form of a Claim for Damages, but this action is an exception to the 
tule as to the limitation of the recovery by the amount of Damages laid. Here it is neither necessary to state the 
correct sum, nor to make the demand large enough to cover all that the proof may establish, as it is the object of the 
action to ascertain what the Damages really are. The plaintiff may have Judgment for a greater sum then he alleges; 
20 and where he states the value of chattels, and also lays Damages, he may obtain Judgment, when entitled to it, for 
the value and also for Damages, distinguishing each. 


STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 


161. While the Common-Law Action of Account, in theory at least, has been abolished, the Conunon Law 
Liability to Account has not been abolished. It may, therefore, be enforced, in some states by a legal action to 
compel an accounting, in which case the Allegations are essentially the same as at Common Law; in others 
the liability may be enforced by a Bill for an Equitable Accounting. In general, this Mode of Procedure is 
favored, being more flexible in character. 


WHAT, then, in the light of the foregoing discussion, is the present status of the Action

of Account under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court? 


In the Missouri case of Hughes v. Woosicy,°° dec,ided after 1848, the plaintiff took an Appeal from an 
order sustaining a Demurrer to a Declaration in an Action of Account. In reversing The Judgment the 
Court remarked: “At the time of the beginning of this suit, this form of remedy was open to the plaintiff, and as he 
has seen proper to adopt it, we are bound to sustain him.” 3- 


And in a subsequent case, Sandwich Mfg. Co. v. Bogie,” decided in 1927, and under the Code, the 
Missouri Supreme Court held that the original claim was in the nature of an Action of Account, and an 
additional and different cause of action could not be subsequently commenced, as, under the facts of the case, it 
would have resulted in a circumvention of the Statute of Limitations. In referring to the Action of Account, the 
Court declared: 


“The relationship disclosed is that of agent and manager of a business—a branch office of the claimant at Kansas 
City. As such agent and manager Losee not only handled the moneys, notes, and accounts of the claimant, but 
merchandise which claimant carried

for sale, and which Losee (working on a fixed salary) sold for claimant, and collected on such sales. The facts 
pleaded in the original claim bring it within thc old Common-Law Action of Account. This was, as said, a Common 
Law Action, so the referee is right in calling it an Action at Law. Our Practice Act has left us a more limited 
number of actions, and trials are had of each in the same Court, but the distinction between Common-Law and 
Equitable Actions are recognized as before. In fact, our several Practice Acts have placed accounts (the items of 
which are legal as distinguished from Equitable) on the law side of our Courts, there to be tried: (1) By the Court 
without a Jury, under named circumstances, (2) to be tried by a Jury, or (3) to be tried by a Referee.” ~ 


Page 332 of 735 


In short, then, despite the fact that the Code had abolished the Common-Law Action in favor of a single, 
formless form of action, the liability to account, as existing at Common Law still remained enforceable under the 
Code and at Law. It followed, therefore, that the Essential Allegations as required at Common Law, 
were still required under the Code, perhaps without some of the detail and technicality which prevailed at 
Common Law.

either Express or Implied in Fact. The term “Special Contract” is often used to denote an Express or Explicit 
Contract as contrasted with a Promise Implied in Law. 

THE Action of Assumpsit, or Trespass on the Case in Assumpsit, is so called from the word “Assumpsit”, which 
means that he undertook or promised, which, when the Pleadings were in Latin, was inserted in the Declaration as 
descriptive of the defendant’s undertaking.” It is a proper Remedy for the Breach of any Simple or Unsealed 
Contract, whether the Contract is Verbal or Written, or whether it is for the payment of money, or for the 
performance of some other act, as to render services or deliver goods, or for the forbearance to do some act.” In no 
case will the action lie unless there has been an actual contract or promise, or unless the law will imply one; for a 
promise either given in fact or implied by law is essential.* 


The Action of Covenant hardened before it could be extended to unwritten agreements, even when made 
upon valuable consideration, and until near the end of the Fifteenth Century such pacts found no remedy.

Assumpsit lies only when damages are sought for the breach of a contract, express or implied. Casey v. Walker & Mosby, 122 Va. 465, 

06 S.E. 434 (1918). 

Prior to the Sixteenth Century the Law of Contracts rested on the foundations of Debt, Covenant and Account, 
but for the development of this branch of the law they proved entirely inadequate, It remained for the 
Action of Special Assumpsit to supply the Remedy for Breach of Simple Contracts, and its 
extension is largely the history of the Substantive Law of Contract. The theory was that when a man undertook by 
promise to do something and then did it improperly, or where he obtained something by a promise and thereafter broke 
his promise, Writs of Trespass on the Case were allowed for the wrong done.” 


The Action of Assumpsit, in its broadest sense, was thus developed from the analogies of Actions Ecr Delicto 
rather than the analogy of Covenant, Debt, or any Action Ex Contractu. What the particular analogies were that 
the Courts strained to transform a tort remedy into a contract remedy in the law of obligations hardly con~rns 
us here. Whether Special Assurnpsit is descended from an Action of Trespass on the Case for Negligent 


Page 334 of 735 


Misfeasance in doing a thing which the defendant had undertaken to do (which is in one aspect an action on the 
promise), or whether Assumpsit has descended from an Action on the Case .in the Nature of Deceit for Nonfeasance to 
Recover Money Paid on the Faith of a Promise, or Damages caused by the deceitful artifice, whether from one or both of 
these, it concerns us principally to know the result at 


5. For Assumpait as Trespass on the Case upon a promise, see the following: Illinois: Carter v. White, 32 III. 509 (1863); Rhode Island: Bagaglio 


v. Paolino, 35 RL 171, 85 Atl. 1048, 44 LEA. (N.S.) 80 (1913), holding that Trespass on the Case Includes both Assumpsit and Case for 
torts. Federal:

which the Courts slowly and painfully arrived,”—a remedy to enforce contractual duties. It is 
interesting to compare the evolution of Assumpsit with that of Detinue, which started with a 
Contractual Theory, and, as it developed, invaded the Field of Tort, although it still retained some of its 
Contractual characteristics. 


The Action of Covenant enforced promises made in writing under Seal simply as promises, expressed in 
such form as to be binding. The Action of Assumpsit as finally developed enforces promises, not because they are 
promises, but only when they are based on Consideration. The Action of Debt on Simple Contract enforced a 
duty to pay for an equivalent already received. But in the Simple Contract the obligation is based on the promise, not 
upon receipt of the quid pro quo, and it is now immaterial whether or not one side of the Consideration has been 
executed. This Action of Assumpsit supplied the much-needed remedy for the recovery of unliquidated Damages for 
the vielation of Express Contracts not under Seal. A great development took place by the extension of this action, 
by means of an Implied or Fictitious Promise, to debts and to obligations in the nature of debt arising from the 
receipt of benefits or value. This Form of the Remedy is distinguished as General Assumpsit; the original Form of 
the Action upon an Actual Promise being called Special Ass umpsit. 


4. Miller v. Ambrose, 3~ App.D.C. 75 (1910). 


It nppenrs that the Nonperfonnance of Promises became actionable in the first part of the Sixteenth Century, or to be specific~ in 


1505, when Money or something of value was obtained by the Fromisor on the faith of his Promise. Accordingly, we find the Language 
of the Declaration in Special Assumpsit to read: “Yet the said defendant, not regarding his said promise, but contriving and fraudulently 
intending, craftily and subtly, to deceive and defraud the plaintiff,” etc. S Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, c. XIV, The Action of 
Special Assumpsit, 176 (Northport 1006). See, also, article by Holdsworth, The Modern Watery of the Doctrine of Conslderation, 2 
B.UL.Eev. 87, 91 (1922). 


The Action of Special Assumpsit will never lie at Common Law on a Specialty. In such cases the proper remedy 
is Debt or Covenant, and not Assumpsit.’ 


Where a Bond or other higher security is taken in the place of a Simple Contract, the mere acceptance of the 
higher security ipso facto merges and extinguishes the lower 
—that is, the Simple Contract—without regard to the intention of the parties, and Special Assumpsit will not 
lie. The action must, therefore, be Covenant or Debt on the higher security.” In order that a merger may thus result, 
however, the subject-matter of the two securities must be identical, and the parties must be the same; and the

security must be taken in the place of the lower, and not merely as collateral security.” There is no merger if the 
higher security is void, as where a usurious bond is taken for money previously lent without usury, and on a 
parol promise to repay it, or where an infant gives a bond with a penalty for necessaries furnished him. In such cases 
Assumpsit may be brought, the higher security being inoperative.” 


SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT—DISTINGUISHED 
FROM AND CONCURRENT WITH 
OTHER ACTIONS 


163. Special Assumpsit, which lies for the breach of an Unsealed Contract, and Covenant, which lies for the 
Breach of a Sealed Contract, are Mutually Exclusive Remedies. Debt, which lies on a Simple (Executed) Contract is 
not tobe confused with Special Assunipsit which lies for the Breach of an Express Promise, or of a 
Simple Contract in the Modern Sense. And Special Assumpsit is distinguishable from Trespass on the Case in that the 
former lies for the Breach of a Promise, whereas the latter lies for Tortious Misconduct resulting in an injury, hut 
they are sometimes concurrent remedies. 


In General 
SPECIAL Assumpsit, having been differentiated from its immediate ancestor, Case for Misfeasance and 
Case for Nonfeasance, and having in consequence achieved status as an Action Ex Contractu, became the rec- 
ognized Form of Action to recover Damages for the Breach of a Modern Simple Contract. As 
such, it is clearly distinguished from Coy

enant, which lies only upon a Sealed Contract, whereas Special Assumpsit lies upon an Unsealed Contract. The two 
actions, therefore, are regarded as mutually exclusive. The action is distinguished from Debt, which lies for the 
recovery of a Specific Sum of money conceived of as belonging to the plaintiff, whereas Special Assumpsit lies 
to recover Damages for Breach of a Promise. While the actions are sometimes concurrent, each proceeds upon 
its own peculiar theory. Assumpsit is grounded upon a right of the plaintiff to be indemnified for some detriment 
incurred as a result of the defendant’s wrongful Breach, whereas Debt is based upon a right of the plaintiff to re- 
cover a sum certain to which he is entitled as a result of some quid pro quo supplied by him to the defendant. 


Special Assumpsit as a Concurrent Remedy with Trespass on the Case for Tort ious Misconduct 


AND, of course, Special Assumpsit, while differing from its Tort Ancestor, Trespass on the Case, in that it lies 
for the breach of a duty imposed by the voluntary act of the parties in executing a contract, whereas in Case, the 
action is to compensate for a wrong independent of any contract obligation, nonetheless sometimes may be 
concurrent with Case, as, for example, where one purchases a railway ticket from one point to another and then 
suffers an injury; he may, if he so desires sue in Special Assumpsit for breach o~ the contract, or he may 


elect” to waive 
right under the contract and sue in Trespass on the Case for the violation of a duty caus 


11. Although an evicted tenant may sue on the covenant for quiet enjoyment, he may elect to treat the eviction by the landlord as an unlawful 
invasion of his rights and sue in Tort. Mitsak-os v. Morrill, 237 Mass. 29, 129 N.E. 294 (1924). 


An Action in Tort may be maintained for the vioL tioa of a duty flowing from relations between par. ties created by Contract Commercial 
City Bank v. Mitchell, 25 Ga.App. 837, 105 SE. 57 (1020).

ing him injury. -The rule applicable to carriers is also applicable to bailees. 


Where property is placed in a person's custody under a contract by which he is to repair the same, or 
carry it, or do any other act in relation to it, anal it is lost or injured by reason of his negligence, there is a 
Breach of Contract as well as a Tort, and the other party may bring Assumpsit instead of Case.” 


In Assumpsit for the value of a boiler placed in the defendants’ custody for repairs, and destroyed by 
reason of their negligence, it was contended that the action should have been in Case, but the action was 
proper. “If there had been no previous contract relation between the parties,” it was said, “Damages 
occasioned by the negligence of the defendants could have been recovered only in an Action on the Case; but the 
fact that the boiler came into the possession of the defendants by reason of, or as incidental to, the 
contract for repairs to be made upon it, imposed the duty upon the defendants to exercise ordinary care for 
the safety and preservation of their customer’s property. By receiving the boiler into their possession for 
the purpose of repairing, they must be held to have subjected themselves to an indertaking, implied from the 


Page 337 of 735 


nature of the express contract for repairs, to do what in good faith and common fairness ought to be done for 
the protection of their customer’s goods. If they have failed in the performance of the duty imposed by this implied 
undertaking, an Action of Assumpsit will lie. At the same time it is true that if the failure involves a tort, such as the 
willful destruction of his customer’s goods, or a conversion

of them to his own use, he may be proceeded against, at the election of his customer, for the Tort and in an 

Action cx delicto.” -There are many other cases where a party may at his election sue either in 

Assumpsit or in Case.’ Thus Assumpsit and Case are concurrent remedies for Breach of Warranty in a sale of 
15 

goods.

DECLARATION IN SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT— 
ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (1) 
IN GENERAL 
165. The Essential Allegations of the Declaration in Special Assumpsit are: 


(D The Statement of the making of the 
contract and the terms of promise on which the action is founded. 
(ID) The Consideration. 
(III) The Performance by plaintiff of all 
conditions precedent. 
(IV) The Breach. 
(V) The Damages. 


DECLARATION IN SPECIAL ASSUMUSIT— ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (2) THE 
STATEMENT OF THE MAKING OF THE 
CONTRACT AND THE TERMS OF 
PROMISE ON WHICH THE ACTION IS 
FOUNDED 


166. The Statement of the making of the contract may consist of an Allegation of the Consideration and 
Promise, and, where necessary, an Inducement, setting forth the Circumstances under which the Contract was 
executed. 


The Promise may be set forth in the Declaration Verbatim or according to its Legal Effect, 


THE statement of the making of the contract is the first important requisite in showing the cause of action in 
Special Assumpsit. It may include either a mere Allegation of the Consideration and Promise, or, where that is not 
sufficient to render intelligible the Count which follows, an explanatory Allegation or Inducement may be necessary. 
In any case, it must be a clear and particular statement of every fact which is necessary, in the particular case, both 
to show what contract was actually made, and to plainly indicate such of its terms, beneficial to the plaintiff, as 
constitute the part for the failure of which he sues."

show the Contract in an intelligible manner, it has been customary to set forth, in the nature of a preamble, the 
Circumstances under which the Contract was made.’-’ This explanatory statement is termed an “Induce- 
ment.” The extent to which it is carried depends upon the necessity for explanatory matter in the particular case. 


Page 339 of 735 


Thus, in Special Assumpsit on an award, the existing difficulties between the parties, resulting in the 
submission to arbitration, are concisely stated by Way of Inducement, as that “certain differences had existed and 
were depending” ; ~and, on a Contract to pay money upon a Consideration of Forbearance, the Declaration should 
begin by stating with brevity the existence of the debt forborne, and from whom it is due.” So, in a Declaration 
against an attorney for negligence, or a carrier or innkeeper for loss of goods, it is proper to show By Way of In- 
ducement that the defendant followed the occupation in respect of which the plaintiff employed him. Unless such an 
Allegation is contained somewhere in the Declaration, the defendant cannot be charged thereon for the breach of a 
duty which results only from the particular character which he held, and in reference to which he was retained.” 


The Promise 
THE Declaration must in all cases show that a Promise has been made, either by expressly 
averring that the defendant “promised,” or by other equivalent words.”

v. Landen, 102 Mass. 58 aseQ) West Virginia: 
Waid v. Dixon, 55 W.Va. 191, 46 SE. 918 (1904); 

Formal words need not be used if it sufficiently appear from the whole Declaration That a Promise has actually been 


made.” The Promise must be stated with certainty and precision, and any material Variance between 
Allegations and the Proof will be fatal. It may be set forth in terms or according to its Legal Effect.” Only such parts 
need be set out as show the entire act required to be done by the defendant.”

An Express Promise ought to be laid in the Declaration. Bannister v. Victoria Coal & Coke Co., 63 W. Va. 502, 61 S.F. 338 (1008).

(Va.) 39 (1799). 


Thus, in Assurnpsit on a Bill of Exchange, where the Declaration showed the defendant’s liability on the Bin as the drawer, but omitted to add 
that he had Promised to Pay, the Court refused to Arrest the Judgment for this omission, and held that the Count was a Count in Assumpsit, 
because the drawing of the Bill was a Promise. Starke v, Cheeseman, 1 Ld.Raym. 538, 01 Eng.Xiep. 1259 (1699).

It is not necessary to state that the Promise was in writing, even when a writing is required by statute,” for the 
writing is not the Contract, but merely evidence of it. The Declaration should, however, specify the 
parties by and to whom the Promise was made,” the time when it was made,” and sometimes the place. And if 
the Promise is alternative, or contains limitations or restrictions of any kind qualifying the manner of performance, 
or the liability of the defendant to perform, the Declaration must correspond in every particular, or there will be a 
fatal misdescription.” “All those parts

of the Contract, which are material for. the purpose of enabling the Court to form a just idea of what the Contract 

actually was, or which are necessary for the purpose of furnishing the Jury with a criterion in the assessment of 

Damages, should be stated with certainty and precision.” ~ 


It is in general sufficient to state those parts of the Contract of which a Breach is alleged, and it is not necessary 
or proper to set out in the Declaration other parts not qualifying or varying the material parts in question.*° The 
statement of additional matter would be confusing prolixity. The perfection of pleading consists in combining brevity with 
certainty and precision. 


It is a general rule that the Contract must be stated correctly, and, if the evidence differs from the 
statement, the whole foundation of the action fails, because the Contract must be proved as laid.”

30. Where the defendant Promises to do two or more things, the plaintiff is only required to set forth that particular part of the Contract which he 
al~ leges the defendant to have broken. It is so where there are several covenants in a deed; the plaintiff may sue for the Breach of any one 
alone. Smith v. Webster, 42 N.H. 142 (1868). 


31. The averment of an absolute Contract to deliver 


40 bags of wheat is not supported by Proof of an 

optional one to deliver 40 or 50 bags, as the Contract must be declared upon in the Declaration according to the original terms of it. Penny v.

Promise and from such statement it must appear that the Consideration alleged is legally sufficient, for 
otherwise it will be nudunt pac 
turn, and hence void. 
Consideration in General 

EXCEPT in cases of Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes, and certain other Contracts that import a 
Consideration,~ it is always necessary for the Declaration expressly to state the Consideration for the Promise, for, if no 
Consideration is alleged, the Promise will appear, from all that the Declaration shows, to be nudum pactuni, and 
therefore void.~~ And it is equally essential that the Consideration alleged shall appear to be legally sufficient to 
support the promise.S1 It may sometimes happen, however, that, even where there is a sufficient Consideration, 
the Declaration, by omitting some averment in stating it, may make it

character can be left to be implied. I Chitty, On Pleading, c. IV Of the Praecipe and Declaration, 321 (6th Am. ed. Springfield 1833); Martin,

34. Thus, if the Consideration for the defendant’s Promise was a Promise by the plaintiff, it must appear that the plaintiff's Promise was binding 
on him when the defendant’s Promise was made; it must not In any case appear that the Consideration was illegal or past. Harding v. Cralgie,

appear insufficient, in which case the Declaration would be as defective as if the Consideration were defective in 
fact. It may not be aided by intendment. Care should therefore be taken, in stating the Consideration, to make 
it appear sufficient on the face of the Declaration.* It has also been laid down as a rule that the Consideration 
stated must be coextensive with the Promise, in order to support it; but this is nothing more than saying that the 
Declaration must show a sufficient Consideration for the Particular Promise alleged.*° 


If no Consideration is stated or that which is stated is clearly illegal or insufficient, the defendant may take 
advantage of the defect either by Demurrer, or by Motion In Arrest of Judgment, or Writ of Error; ~ but a de

Thus, where the plaintiff declared that a person, since deceased, was Indebted to him, and that after the death, in Consideration of the premises, 
“and that the plaintiff, at the defendant’s request, would give time for the payment of the debt,” the defendant Promised, etc., but did not state 
that there was any person in existence who was liable, in respect of assets or otherwise, to be sued by the plaintiff for the debt, and to whom 
he gave time—the Declaration was held bad on Demurrer; for no benefit was shown to move to tbe defendant, nor did it appear that any 
detriment had been sustained by the plaintiff, as it was not stated that anyone was liable to be sued by him, or that he had suspended the 
eaforeement of any right. Jones v. Ashburnham, 4 East 455, 102 Eng.Rep. 905 (1804).

fective statement will be Aided by a Verdict for the plaintiff if it sufficiently appear, upon a 
reasonable construction of the Declaration, that there was in fact a Consideration capable of supporting the 
Promise. *® 


In all cases the statement should be accurate, for the Consideration is essential to the Contract, and if it is 
misdescribed the Contract is misdescribed.*” 


The Consideration must be shown with certainty and particularity, Nothing that is essential can be left to 
implication and intendment. The degree of certainty will vary somewhat, according to the particular kind of the 
Consideration. An averment that the promise was made for a Valuable Consideration, without setting forth what it 
was, is insufficient upon General Demurrer.*? 


Executed Considerations 

CONSIDERATIONS are either Executed or Executory. An Executed Consideration consists of something done 
before or at the time of the Promise, at the request of the promisor. In these cases it must be shown by the 
Declaration that the Consideration arose at the Promisor’s (defendant’s) request." It is said not to be necessary, in

to quantity, quality, value, etc., as is required in stating Executory Considerations.” It must, however, be shown that 
the Executed Consideration was furnished at the defendant’s request. 


Executory Considerations 
AN Executory Consideration is where the Contract is bilateral; that is, 
where a Promise is given for a Promise, each Promise being the Consideration for

the other. In these cases a greater degree of certainty is required than in stating an Executed Consid- 
eration. The performance of his Promise by the plaintiff may have been, according to the terms of the Contract, a 
condition precedent to the defendant’s liability to perform his Promise; or each may have been 
required to perform concurrently with the other; or the plaintiff may have been required to continue to do 
or forbear some act. 


In the statement of an Executory Consideration precedent—that is,a promise by the plaintiff which was 
required to be performed as a condition precedent to performance by the defendant—a great degree 
of certainty is required.” “The Consideration, and the Promise of the defendant, are two distinct things,

Allegation being material and Traversable, must be made with proper certainty of time and place, etc. This obligation of 
averring performance imposes upon the plaintiff the necessity of stating the Consideration with a greater degree of

judge whether the performance averred in the Declaration were sufflcient.” «

In an Action for Breach of a Contract by which the plaintiff had agreed to buy a certain quantity of corn of the defendant at a certain price, and 
the defeadant had promised to deliver the corn within one month, the plaintiff merely alleged that he had always been ready and willing to 
receive the corn, but that it had not been delivered within the month. The Court held that readiness to receive was not a sufllcient performance 


of his obligation by the plaintiff; that payment of the price Was intended to be concurrent with delivery of the corn. As the jdaintlff did not 
allege that, during the time In which delivery might have been made, he had been teady to pay the price, there was nothing, as be had shaped 
his ease, to show that he bad riothimLeif broken the Contract and discharged the de

If any error is made in describing the Consideration which forms the basis of the Contract, this may be a fatal 
Variance, as the whole Contract must be proved as stated, and the plaintiff will fail at the Trial unless permitted to 
Amend his Declaration. It is necessary that the whole of the Consideration should in general be stated and that it be 
proved to the extent alleged.*”

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 


168. The Declaration must allege the Performance or Fulfillment of all Conditions Precedent to the 
defendant’s duty to perform his Promise. it must allege Due Performance by the 
plaintiff, or aver a sufficient Excuse for Nonperformanee. Where Reciprocal Promises involve Mutual 
Conditions, to be performed at the same time, tlre plaintiff must aver Performanee of his part of the Contract, or a 
readiness and an offer to perform. 


A Condition which merely affords a Defense or Excuse for Failure to Perform a Contract is Matter of 
Defense, which need not be negatived in the Declaration. The border line as to what Conditions should be 
Negatived in the Declaration and what should be set up as a Defense is doubtful and uncertain. 


WHERE the Consideration for the defendant’s Promise was past or executed when the Promise was 
made; or where, though the Contract consisted of mutual promises, the performance of his Promise by the 
defendant was not dependent or conditional upon performance by the plaintiff; nor up-oh any 


other subsequent event, as the act of some third person, or the lapse of a certain

In case of Reciprocal Promises, constituting Mutual Conditions to be performed at the same time, the plaintiff 
must aver Performance by him, or a readiness and Offer to Perform, or an Excuse for not 
Offering to Perform.” 


The Averment of Performance will, of course, be unnecessary where the plaintiff has been prevented, or in some manner discharged, by the

A Spurgin, 5 Sneed (Penn.) 081 (1558). 

In such a case, the plaintiff must state the Excuse for his Nonperformanee. In so doing, the particular Circumstances constituting the Matter of 
Excuse, including the plaintiffs readiness, must be alleged, as it is aot sufficient to net forth merely the fact that he was so prevented or 
discharged from completing his obligation. Indiana: Borne Ins. Co. of New York v. Duke, 43 md. 418 (1873);

The omission of the Averment of Performance of a Condition Precedent, or of an Excuse for the Nonperformance, 
is fatal on Demurrer, or on objection after Judgment by Default; 6o but after a Verdict the omission may in some cases be

Conditions Subsequent and Provisos 

THE plaintiff need not refer to Conditions Subsequent, but may leave it to the defendant to plead them, if he so 
desires, by way of Defense. The mere Language of a Condition, however, will not indicate with certainty whether 
it is Precedent or Subsequent. In fact, Professor Williston declares: “What are generally called 
Conditions Subsequent in Contracts are so called with little propriety. They are in substance Conditions 
Precedent to the Vesting of Liability and are subsequent only in Form.” 63 “Insurance policies always expressly

DECLARATION EN SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT— 
ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (5) THE 
BREACU 


169. The Breach, in Special Assumpsit, Is the violation of his Contract by the defendant. Being an essential 
ground of the action, the Declaration must state it expressly and with certainty, but less particularity is requisite when 
the facts constituting it lie more properly within the knowledge of the defendant. 


AS the Breach of a Contract is obviously an essential part of the cause of action, it cannot be omitted from the 
Declaration.” The manner of its Allegation must necessarily be governed by the nature of the Promise or stipulation 
broken.” It should be Assigned in the words of the Contract, either negatively or affirmatively, or in words which 
are co-extensive with its import and effect.°? Though the express words of the

Arkansas: Patterson v. Jones, 13 Ark. 09, 56 Am. hoc, 206 (1852), 

The words of the Contract need not necessarily be used; but it is necessary that the words employed shall show clearly that the Contract has been 
brolcon. Thus, in Debt on a Bond, conditioned for the payment of an annual sum for “the wile” of the obligee, a Breach assigned in 


Page 348 of 735 


Nonpayment to the 

“obligee”, is insuffléient. English: Lunn v, Payne, O Taunt. 140, 128 Eng.Rep. 986 (1815); Kentucky: 

Moxley’s Adm’rs v. Mox)ey, 2 Mete. (Ky.) 309 (1859); New Hampshire: Atlantic Met. Fire Ins. Co. v. Young, 38 N.H. 451, 75 Am.Dec. 200 
(1859). 


If the Breach assigned varies from the sense and Substance of the Contract, and is either more innited or larger than the Promise, it will be 
insntTh dent. Thus, in the case of a Promise to repair a fence, except on the west side thereof, a Broach thnt the defendant did not repair the 
fence, without showing that the want of repair ~vaS ia other parts of the fence than on the west, is bad on Demurrer, though it may be Aided 
by Verdict. I Chitty, On Plending, c. TV, Of the Praecipe and Declaration, 367 (Springfield, 1833); Comyn. Dig. “Vlendei-”, C. 

47 (London, 1522). It is unsafe to unnecessarily narrow the Breach. Thus, where the Breach assigned was that the defendant had not used a 
farm in a husband1lil~e manner, ‘~p~ on the contrary had committed waste,” it was lJeld that the plaintiff could not give evidence of the tie- 
feudnnts using the farm in an unln,sbandlihe manner, if such misconduct did not amount to waste, though on the former words of the as- 
signinent such evidence would have been admissible. 1 Chitty, On Pleading, c. IV, Of the Praocipe and Declaration, 368 (Springfield, 1833); 


Harris v. Mantle, 3 Term.fl. 307, 100 Eng.Rep. 591 (1789). 


The safest course is to state the Breach flrst in the words of the Contract, and then to superadd that the defendant, disregarding, did so and so, 
showing any Particular Breaches not narrowing or prejudicing the previous general assigliment, so that the plaintiff retains the advantage 
of both; and no inconvenience can result from laying the Breach as extonsively as the Contract, for the plaintiff may recover nithough he 
only prove a part of the Breach as laid. I Cbitty, Oa Pleading, c. IV, Of the Declaration, 346 (Springfield, 1876); Barnard v. Oaths, 5 Taunt.

Contract will generally be sufficient, they may not always be so. The assignment must not be too general; it must 
show the subject-matter bf complaint.~° “And therefore 

parcel of the farm; B in Declaring on the Covenant, need not take notice of the Proviso.” os For it is in the nature of 
a Condition Subsequent, of whjch A may avail himself in Defense, if he has performed the act mentioned in the 
Proviso, A distinction analogous to that stated prevails in declaring upon penal statutes. Where an Exception is 
incorporated with the Enacting Clause of a Statute, he who pleads the clause ought to plead 
the Exception. But it is otherwise of a Proviso; that is a Subsequent and Independent Clause, 


which provides that in certain cases the statute shall not operate.

it seems that a general averment quad non per forrnav~t, or that ‘the defendant did not perform the said 
agreement,’ is insufficient [on Demurrer, though Aided by Verdictj, because ‘did not perform his agreement’ might 
involve a question of law, and also because the object of pleading is to apprise the defendant of the cause of 
complaint, so that he may prepare his Plea and Defense and Evidence in answer.” 7 But “where the breach lies more 
in the defendant’s than the plaintiff’ s knowledge, less particularity is required.” 72 

Where the matter to be performed by the defendant is contingent upon the happening of some other 
event, the Breach should not be Assigned in the Words of the Contract, but it should first be averred 
that such event has taken place; ~ and, if the Contract is in the Alternative or the Disjunctive, it is oh.. vious that 
the Assignment should be that the defendant did not do one act or the other.’-! 


The omission to Assign a Breach renders the Declaration fatally defective, not only on Demurrer, but on Motion

DECLARATION IN SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT— ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (6) TIHE 
DAMAGES 


170. The Declaration in Special Assumpsit should state the Damages which arise as the Direct and Legal, 
and sometimes the Actual, though not the Direct, Consequences of the 
Breach. Such Damages may be General or Special, and should be alleged according to their nature. 


WHEREVER there has been a Breach of Contract, the plaintiff is necessarily entitled 
to some compensation in the way of Damages, though it may often be difficult to ascertain the amount)’ They must 
always be the direct or proximate result of the facts stated, and it is a general rule of 
pleading that the declaration must allege them, whether they are the main object of the action or only an 
incident. The amount recoverable in Special Assumpsit is generally fixed by the terms or nature of the Contract 
itself, under recognized rules of law, and may be only the contract price with interest, or it may include Special or 
Consequential Damage in addition. The manner of stating the Damage will depend upon its character, as General or 
Special; but a sum large enough to cover the whole claim must be alleged, as it is a general

Damages arising subsequent to the Commencement of the Action were not generally allowed at Common Law, the Judgment being taken to refer

surprise. Duncan v. Markley, 1 Harp. (S.C.) 276 (1824); Comyn, Dig. “Damages,” I) (London, /822). 


It Is now the general rule, though its application is not free from difficulty, that such Damages may be included in the recovery where they are 
the direct and material consequences of the Breach, and so connected with it that they would not sustain an action by themselves. English:

THE Status of Special Assumpsit under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court, clearly appears from a 
series of cases to which reference will now be made. 


Long before the Code of 1848, in the pivotal New York ease of Thoi-ne c~ Thorne v. Deas,*° decided in 1809, 
which involved an Action of Trespass on the Case Super Se Assumpsit for a Nonfeasance in not causing insurance 
to be taken on a certain vessel, Chief Justice Kent, after reviewing the eal’)y Common Law learning on the 
development of Special Assumpsit out of Trespass on the Case, from Watton v. Brinth,”' decided in 1400, to 
the Anonymous Caae in 1505,52 held that the promise to take out insurance was not good, without 
showing a Consideration. In Candler c~ Hart v. Rossiter,” decided in 1833, the plaintiff declared in Assumpait for 
Money Paid, omitting the ordinary Super Be Assumpsit—that the defendant undertook and promised—and instead 
thereof stated the circumstances of his case, to wit, that he bought a quantity of fish for the purpose of shipping it to 
a foreign port; that defendant, as a joint adventure placed a similar quantity of fish on board the same vessel, the 
parties to share the profit arid loss; that the fish were so damaged at sea, that they were sold at a loss, the whole of 
which the plaintiff sustained and paid, without having received any part thereof from the defendant, whereby the 
plaintiff was damaged in the sum of $500. On Writ of Error, after a Trial and Verdict for the 
plaintiff, it was held that the Declaration was bad in not alleging a promise by the defendant and hi not setting forth 
a consideration. In reversing the Judgment below, Sutherland, J., declared:

clerical omission, as the sentence in each was obviously imperfect without the words Undertook and Promised— 
Super Sc Assumpsit, &c.; but They mark strongly the indispensable importance of the Allegation 
that the defendant promised, &c. Mr. Lawes, whose treatise on pleading in the Action of Assurnpsit is of the 
highest authority, seems to consider the omission of the Allegati on as fatal, after Verdict. This 
doctrine, upon the authority of the preceding cases, was also admitted by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in 3 
Mass.R. 160; opinion of Sedgwick, J., page 176. Judge Gould, in his valuable treatise on pleading, speaking on the 


Page 351 of 735 


subject of direct and positive averments, says, the rule appears to be, that all those facts which are directly denied by 
the terms of the general issue, or which may, by the established usage of pleading, be specially traversed, must be 
averred in direct and positive terms. Thus, in Assumpsit the Promise must be stated in terms direct and 
positive, because the general issue, Non ..4ssumpsit, purports to be a direct denial of the Promise. Gould’s Treatise 
on Plead. 73, § 42, 44, 75. Considering therefore, that no contract or agreement whatever is distinctly stated, nor any 
promise by the defendant, nor any consideration for a promise, I think the Judgmerit must be arrested. 
These defects are not cured by the Statute of Jeofails; it is the case of a defective title, and not of a good title 
defeCtively set out” ~ 


After the adoption of the Code of 1848, in the case of Bootft v. The Farmers c~ Mechanics’ National Bank of 
Rochester,” the plaintiff filed a Declaration in Assumpsit containing two Counts. The first Count set forth 
that the defendant had assigned to the plaintiff a Judgment, that thereafter the defendant discharged the Judgment; 
that the defendants in the Judgment owned personal property, which, but for the discharge of the

—1 Thomp. & C. 45, 65 Barb. 457 (1873). 

Judgment would have been liable to execution and sale; and the defendants in the Judgment are now insolvent; 
and the plaintiff has been injured by the discharge. The second Count alleged that defendant was 
in. debted to the plaintiff for Money Had and Received. The defendant demurred on the ground of a Misjoinder of 
Actions, viz, one for a Tort, and one on Contract. On an Appeal from an Order overruling the 
Demurrer, the Order was reversed. 


The first Count omitted the Allegation that the defendant undertook and promised to do the act 
complained of—that is. the Implied Promise by the defendant not to satisfy the Judgment. Without such an 
Allegation the Count was in Case. And as the second Count was in Contract, there was a violation of the then 
tule of pleading that Tort and Contract Actions could not be joined. In reversing the Order of the Lower 
Court, the Court dedared; 


“The Codifiers, while proposing to abolish the distinction between Forms of Actions, found it impossible or 
impracticable, in many cases, to effect their object, and this case illustrates the failure in at least one class of cases. 
When Case and Assumpsitwere, at Common Law, Concurrent Remedies, the Form of Action that the 
pleader selected was determined, as I have shown, by the insertion or omission from the Declaration of the 
Allegation, that the defendant “undertook and promised.” This right of selection remains, and 
Whether the action is in Tort or Assumpsit must be determined by the same criterion. If this is not so, then 
the right of election is taken away. If taken away, which of the two is left? An Action on 
Contract cannot be joined with one in Tort. How are we to determine whether the action is One on 
Contract or in Tort, unless the pleader, by averment, alleges the making of the Contract, and demands damages £ or 
a Breach in the one case, or by the omission of such an averment makes it an 
686 

OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
cit. 16 
Action in Tort? I know of no more certain or convenient criterion by which to determine the 
class to which a Cause of Action belongs than the one suggested. If some such rule is 
notestablished the question of misjoinder will arise inevery case hi which, at Common 
Law, Assumpsit and Case were Concurrent Remedies.” ~ 


In the case of Glanzerv. Shepard, decided in 1922,87 public weighers were requested 
by the seller to weigh goods sold, and were paid for their services by the 
seller, andthe property was accepted and paid for by the plaintiffs, the buyers, on the 
faith of the weigher’s certificate. Upon discovering that the actual weight was short by 11,854 
pounds, the plaintiffs brought suit for $1,261.-26, the amount over paid. In the City Court of New York, the Trial 
Judge, upon Motion made by each side for the direction of a Verdict, gave Judgment for the 
plaintiffs. The Appellate Term reversed upon the ground that the plaintiffs had no 


Page 352 of 735 


contract with the defendants, weighers, and must seek their remedy against the seller, 
whereupon the Appellate Division reversed the Appellate Term and reinstated the 
Verdict. On Appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Judgment. Judge Cardozo declared; 
“We state the defendant’s obligation, therefore,interms, not of contract merely, but of 


duty. Other forms of statement are possible. They involve, at most, a change of emphasis?’

In the Illinois case of Banik v. BishopStoddard Cafeteria Co., The .°° decided under the Illinois Practice 
Act, a former employee of a corporation, which had agreed to buy his stock in the 
corporation upon the termination of his employment, upon refusal of the corporation to buy the stock, filed a suit to 
recover damages equal to the difference between the amount which the corporation had agreed to pay and the 
amount realized from sale thereof on the open market. The Declaration consisted 
of the Common Counts, to which the defendant pleaded the General Issue and two Special Pleas, one of 
which stated that the alleged promises were not evidenced by any writing, and hence were 
within the Statute of Frauds, while the other stated that the alleged promises were without consideration. 
At the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, and at the close of allthe evidence, the defendant moved for a 
Directed Verdict. The Motion having been de&ed, a Verdict was rendered finding the 
defendant liable andassessing the plaintiff’s damages at $758.00. The defendant moved 
for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, in Arrest of Judgment and for a New Trial, 
which Motions were denied, although with a Remittiter of $350, after which Judgment was 
rendered in favor of Plaintiff, On Appeal, the Judgment was reversed and remanded, the Court stating that 
the Common Counts cannot be resorted to where there is a Special Contract and the Breach thereof is the gray- 
amen of the action, but in such case the plaintiff must declare specially. 


From the foregoing discussion, it appears that the Action of Special Assumpsit, 
despite the efforts at reform, is still alive and vigorous, not only in the Non-Code States, but 


also in States operating under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court.

and Indebitatus or General Asslmrnpsit. As differentiated, Special Assumpsit became the remedy for 
the Breach of an Actual, Express Promise contained in a Contract entered into by the 
parties, whereas Indebitatus Assumpsit became the remedy in the field of Simple 
(Executed) Contract, the action not being grounded upon a Special Contract or Actual Promise, 
but upon-a promise Implied by Law from the existence of a legal duty to pay money 
for value received. 


Con tiacts Implied in Fact and in Law 


IN this connection, however, it should at once be observed that the term 
“Implied Contracts” has been and is used in at least two senses. 


Page 354 of 735 


As used in one sense it means a Tacit Contract, Implied as a Matter of Fact from the conduct of the parties, 
because their course of conduct shows agreement, as where one of them has delivered goods to or performed

services for another, at the other’s request or with the other’s knowledge, and under such 
circumstances as to raise a presumption that the other, as a reasonable man, must have known that payment for them 
was expected. Although no Express Promise to pay was made, the Law recognizes that by his conduct he 
Impliedly Promised to Pay, and to enforce this Implied in Fact Promise, Assumpsit is the proper remedy.” 


The term “Implied Contract,” as used in a 

-second sense, is applied to promises Implied or Created by Operation of Law, without any agreement 
between the parties, and oftentimes, even when the circumstances actually negative the existence of any agreement 
whatsoever, as where one pays money which another person ought to have paid, or receives money 
which another ought to have received, or, in some cases, where benefits are conferred upon another without 
any agreement. The Promise thus said to be Implied in Law is a sheer fiction of Law, resorted 
to for the purpose of allowing a remedy in Assumpsit. Such Obligations are not Contractual, but Quasi- 
Contractual,’ 


EXPRESS CONTRACTS WHICH DO NOT 
EXCLUDE INDEIIITATUS ASSUMPSET 


173, Indebitaths or General Assumpsit will not lie where there has been an Express Contract, except that it may be 
permitted in instances such as the following: 


(I) Where the facts underlying the Express Contract are equivalent to the legal duty created by the Con- 
tract. 
(ID ‘Where the Contract, or some divisible part thereof, has been Fully Executed by the plaintiff, and nothing 
remains but the payment of money by the defendant.

event 
which in law operates as a discharge of the Contract, or if the Contract is abandoned or rescinded. 
(V) Where the Contract is merely void 
(not illegal), or merely unenforceable, or voidable and has been avoided, there may be a recovery 
in General Assumpsit for Part Performance. - 
(VI) Where Additional Work has been 
done on request in performing a Special Contract. 


THE general rule of law is that if there is an Executory Special Contract, Indebitatus .Assumpsit will not 
lie; for the Jaw will not Imply a Promise to pay, except where the 
Consideration is Executed on the plaintiff’s part and a duty arises to pay the value of 
what he has done.” 


The leading English case of Cutter v. Powell,~ is cited in the leading American 
case of

Cases, 1, notes, 9 (13th ed. by Chitty, Denning &

166 Ill. App. 20 (1911); Indiana: Edward Thompson 
Co. v. Kollmeyer, 40 Ind.App. 400, 92 N.E. 660 (1910). To recover in Assumpait for Breach of an Executory 
Contract of Salc of corporate stock, plaiutiff must Declare Specially on the Contract, General Counts alone not being sufficient except whcre 
payment is the only unperformed act. Thomas v. Mott, 78 W. Va, 113, 88 SE. 651 (1016). 


Where a Special Contract remains Executory, the plaintiff must sue upon it. Maryland: Waddell v. Phillips, 133 Mcl. 497, 105 A. 771 (1910);

Hersey v. I’Torthern Assurance Co.” in which the Court alluded to the Common Law rule as follows: 
“In the present ease the facts aside from the Promise, viz: the plaintiff’s 
ownership of the property, its destruction by fire without his fault,—even the payment of 
premiums,—do not raise an Implied Promise by the defendant to pay; it is only the fact that it 
Promised, upon certain conditions, to pay, that makes it liable. Con- 
sequently, at Common Law, the Promise, the Conditions, and the Fulfillment of 
the Conditions, must be set forth—in other words the Count must be Special.” z

But an Express Contract, under which a transaction has been Partially or Wholly 
ecuted, does not always exclude an Action of Indebitatus or General Assumpsit for money due on such 
transaction. The factual situation involved may give rise to an Implied 
Contract, in which case recovery may be had on a Common Count. The occasions 


when this may occur may be grouped under the following heads:

(III) Where there is a plaintiff has not formed, but the ceived a benefit. 

(I) Where the Facts Underlying the Express Contract are Equivalent to the Legal Duty Created by the 
Contract.—Where the Express Contract in question creates no other obligation than that which the Law would 
normally imply from the existing factual situation, a Common Count in Indebitatus Assumpsit 
will lie; Thus, in Gibbs v. Br~ ant,’ where the defendant had made a written 
promise to indemnify the plaintiff for a payment made by the plaintiff, it 
was held that the action could be supported for the payment of money by the plaintiff for the use

of the defendant, even though there was an Express Promise to pay the debt.’ 


(IT) Where the Express Contract has been Fully Executed or Performed, and nothing remains but the 
Payment of Money big the Dc! endant.—If the Contract has been Fully Executed by the plaintiff and 
nothing remains to be done but the payment of the price in money by the defendant, the plain- 
tiff may either declare in Special Assumpsiton the Contract, or he may declare 
in General Assumpsit, at his Election, or he may join the Common Counts with 
Special Counts.?° 


9- if, by the terms of the Special Contract which the plaintift has performed, ho is to be psi0, not In money, but in specific articles, the action must 
be Ia Special Assurapsit. Thus, the Common Counts will not lie where the price is payable partly in cash and partly by the conveyance of land,

Action would be upon the Common Counts.”

ACTION OF INDEDITATUS ASSUMPSIT 


(m) Where there is an Express Contract and the Plaintiff has not Substantially Performed, but the 
Defendant has received a beneflt.—Where the plaintiff has, without his wilful default, failed to perform the 
Special Contract, in some material respect, within the time or in the manner therein stipulated, 
he cannot maintain Special Assumpsit on the Contract, as he cannot show Substantial Performance on his part?- If 
he can recover at all, it must be in General Assumpsit, on a Promise by the defendant Implied in 
Law because of the benefits received by him. As to whether he can recover at all, even in General 
Assumpsit, the authorities are not in agreement. The question is whether the Law will refuse a 
party in default any relief or will Imply a Promise by the defendant 

to Pay for the benefits received by him. If it will, General Assumpsit will lie; but, if it will not, there can be no 
recovery at all. The question must be answered by the Substantive Law of Contract or Quasi-Contract.”*

if, after such Partial Performance, the Contract is abandoned by mutual consent, or waived or rescinded it__the 
plaintiff may maintain General Assumpsit to recover for what he has done. Or, in the case of 
prevention of Further Performance by the defendant, the plaintiff may, at his Election, sue in Special

It was held in Illinois that a recovery of tIme balance due on a building Contract cannot be had under Common Counts, where the contractor 
relies on Matter of Excuse for not procuring the final certificate of approval by the architect; but in case of Substantlal Performance, where no 
certificate is called for, recovery may he had under the Common Counts for labor and material in spite of slight variations. Why the plaintiff 
cannot show excuse for non-production of an architect’s certificate under the Corn-men Counts to show a recoverable indebtedness for value 
received Is not entirely clear. Expanded 


(V) Where the Contract is Merely Void (Not %llega7), or Merely Unenforceable, or Voidable and has 
been Avoided, there may be a Recovery in General Assumpsit for Part Performance—If the Special 
Contract, which the plaintiff has Partially Performed, is void (not illegal), or unenforceable, or voidable and has 
been avoided by the plaintiff or defendant, General Assumpsit may be maintained for the 


Partial Performance. This rule, as is indicated in the note below, is subject to some qualification."

by a corporation, or for any other reason, and one of the parties refuses to perform his part after Performance or Part Performance by the other, 
the Law will create a Promise to Pay for the benefits received. If a man delivers goods or perferrns services for another under a centract which 
is thus void ~r unenforceable, but not illegal in the sense of being unlawful, he may recover in General Assumpsit the value of the goods or

INDEBITATUS ASSUMPSJT DISTINGUISHED FROM AND CONCURRENT WITH 
OTHER ACTIONS 


174. Indebitatus Assumpsit is in general a substitute for Debt on Simple (Executed) Contract; it was not, 
however, as broad as Debt, as it was not available on a Specialty, a Record or a Statute, in general, It was 
distinguished from Special Assuiupsit which lay for Breach of an Express Contract, whereas Indebitatus 
Assumpsit lay for the recovery of a debt or an obligation akin to a debt. The Action was Concurrent with Debt, Special 
Assumpsit and Trover, under certain circumstances, and subject to certain necessary qualifications. 

IT is essential that the distinctions between Indebitatus Assumpsit and other actions should be clearly understood. It is 
frequently said that Indebitatus Assumpsit is a substitute for Debt on Simple (Executed) Contract. For all practical 
purposes this is true, but in order to be technically correct, the statement requires some qualification, as strictly 
speaking, Indebitatus Assumpsit differed from Debt in that it might be maintained in situations where the sum 
alleged to be due was not susceptible of precise proof,” as required in Debt; it could be used 
to recover installments of a debt which in its entirety was not yet due; 2:and it lay against

an Executor or Administrator, against whom Debt would not lie under the Early Common Law where the testator 
had the right to demand Trial by Wager of Law.” However, until Debt was extended to cover obligations which 
were not certain, but which might be reduced to certainty by averment or proof, Debt was 
not a remedy for Obligations similar to but not identical with a True Common-Law Debt, and HOW known as 
Quasi-Contractual Obligations. And while Indebitatus Assumpsit would usually lie where Debt would lie, the 
converse was not true. As Dean Ames has pointed out, there were many cases where Assumpsit was the only 
remedy, as the benefit received did not constitute a Real Debt or a Real Contract.” 


In a certain sense, however, Debt was broader than Indebitatus Assumpsit, as the latter action would not lie on a 
Specialty, a Record, or a Statute, generally; Indebitatus Assumpsit was a substitute for Debt originally 
only in the Field of Debt on Simple (ExeCuted) Contract; and in the sense that originally Debt was not available on 
Quasi-Contractual Obligations, whereas Indebitatus Assumpsit would lie, the latter action might be said to be 
broader than the former. 


Special Assumpsit was an action to recover Damages for the Breach of an Express Contract, whereas Indebitatus 
Assumpsit was an action to recover a Common-Law debt, and finally, to recover obligations akin to debts, but 
not quite identical therewith. 


But as we have seen, Indebitatus Assumpsit and Debt were concurrent in the 
field of Debt on Simple (Executed) Contract, and Indebitatus Assumpsit may and frequently 
is concurrent with Special Assumpsit, where, over and above the Simple, Executed Contract, 
which supports the former action, 


22. On the present validity of this distinction, see Ohildress v. Emory, 8 Wheat. (U.S.) 642, 5 L.Ed. 705 (1823). 
Cl. 17 


there is also an Express Promise, which has been Breached. And in such a case it may be eminently judicious to 
so frame the Declaration in Assumpsit as to permit the plaintiff to avail himself of either basis of 
liability. This result may be attained by declaring in a Special Count upon the Actual or Express Contract and 
thereafter adding one or more Common Counts, covering the meritorious services the rendition of which may be 
proved. 


Moreover, under certain circumstances, Indebitatus Assumpsit is a concurrent remedy with Trover. Thus, where a 
defendant has taken and converted the chattels of the plaintiff amid sold them, at his Election, the plaintiff may sue 
in Trover for the Conversion, or he may Waive the Tort, and sue in Indebitatus Assumpsit on a Count for Money 
Had and Received.

Page 364 of 735 


IN Indebitatus or General Assumpsit the action is based, not on an Express or Special 
Promise, but on a Promise Implied by Law from the existence of a duty to pay money, arising either from a debt 
created by a Simple, Executed Contract or from an Obligation raised by Quasi-Contract. Like Debt, 
for which it was a substitute in certain areas, it specifically enforces the 
unconditional duty to pay money. Indebitatus or General Assumpsit lies upon a debt arising from the passage 
of a quid pro quo from the plaintiff to the defendant, upon a debt arising from a Contract Implied in Fact, and 
which has been Executed, leaving nothing to be done

but pay the debt, and upon a debt arising from a Contract Implied in Law, and known as Constructive or 
Quasi-Contract. 


And, in setting forth his Declaration, the pleader need not indicate which variety of Implied 
Contract—in fact or in law—he relies upon. But as the Executed Consideration is an indebtedness, 
and the Promise alleged to have been broken is one legally resulting from the fact of such indebtedness, the 
Proof at the Trial must show a debt. It follows, therefore, that the action in reality is one for the recovery o a Money 
Debt, due upon a Simple (Executed) Contract, such, for example, as upon the sale of goods, or 
lands,” for rendition of services, for work, labor and materials, or on an Account Stated, as well as other similar 
transactions resulting in the enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff s expense. 


If a person requests another to do work for him under such circumstances that the other 
has a right to expect pay therefor, and the latter does the work, the Law will, as an Inference of Fact, Imply a 
Promise by the former to pay what the services were reasonably worth, and the action to recover such 
compensation is General Assumpsit. So, ifa man orders goods from another without an Express Promise 
to Pay a certain price, and they are delivered, the seller may maintain Ceneral Assumpsit to recover their value. 
So, if a person pays money which another should have paid, he may maintain General Assumpsit 
against the latter to recover it, such a Count being known as a Count for Money Paid by the plaintiff for the use 
of the defendant. And where a man receives money which in equity and good conscience belongs to another, the 
latter may sue in General Assumpsit to recover, this Count being known as the Count for Money Re

ceived by the defendant for the use of the! plaintiff, or for Money Had and Received. And where a man lends 
money to another without an Express Promise by the latter to repay it, he may recover the debt in General 
Assumpsit on a Count for Money Lent. And if parties state an account between them, General Assumpsit 
lies for the balance, the Count being known as a Count for a balance due on Account Stated. General Assumpsit 
is also known as the Common Counts. The Common Counts are riot suited to enforce 
Collateral Undertakings, Guaranties, and Contracts of Indemnity.

Recovery on a fire insurance policy cannot be had on the Common Counts, as 
payment of the premiums is not sufficient of itself to constitute a quid pro quo or raise an 
Implied Promise. Accordingly the Promise itself and the conditions thereof must be 
specifically set forth. But in case of adjustment of the loss this makes an Account Stated, and the Implied 
Promise to Pay the amount due is regarded as a different Contract from the Policy itself, which may be enforced 
by the Common Counts.”°

(I) The Indebitatus Counta—In an Indebitatus Count in Assumpsit, the most comprehensive of all, the plaintiff 
alleges that the defendant, on a certain day, at a certain place, was indebted to him in a certain sum, for a certain 
described Cause or Consideration furnished by the plaintiff, and stating the Consideration ~ to have been furnished 
at the special instance and request of the defendant.” In general, time and place are 
immateriaL-*? If the suit is in a Court of In 


30. OrLuim of the Common Counts: “in declaring in Debt, except possibly upon an Account Stated, the plathti~ was required to set forth his 
cause of action with great particularity-. Thus, the Count in Debt must state the quantity and description of goods sold, with the details of the 
price, all the particulars of a loan, the names of the pe,’sons to whom the money was paid with the amounts of each payment, the namcs of 
the persons from whom money was received to the use of the plaintiff with the amounts of each receipt, the precise nature and amount of 
services rendered. Ta Indebitatus Assumpait, on the other band, the debt being laid as an Inducement or Conveyance to the Assumpsit, it was 
not necessary to set forth all the details of the transaction from which it arose. It was enough to allege the general nature of the indebtedness, 
as for goods sold, money lent! money paid at the defendant’s request, money bad and received to the plaft~tiff’s use, work and labor at the 
defendant’s request, or upon an Account Stated, and that the defendnnt being so indebted Promised to Pay. This was the origin of the 
Common Counts.” Ames! Lectures on Legal flistory, e. XIV, Implied Assurnpsit, 153, 154 (Cambridge, 1913).

And consequently, in those states where special Demurrers have been abolished, it would seem that the Allegation of some of these facts 
would be unnecessary, though it is certainly the better practice to allege them. Alabama: McCrary v. Brown, 157 Ala. 518, 50 So. 402 (1909);

ferior Jurisdiction, the Declaration should allege that the cause of action arose within such 
Jurisdiction.” The sum stated in the Declaration is generally also immaterial, provided it be laid to cover at least the 
actual amount due” the cause of the debt, as well as the debt itself, should be included so as to ground a 
subsequent Flea of Res Judicata.*° And, of course, it must appear that the consideration for the debt was furnished at the 
Request of the defendant.” And these Indebitatus Counts were of two descriptions, Money Counts, and Other 
Counts. 


(A) The Money Counts—The Money Counts relate only to Money Transactions as the basis of the debt, 
while the other Counts relate to any transaction other thana Money Transaction upon which a debt 
may be founded. These Counts, in the order listed in the chart above, will now 
be separately considered.

Sec. 176 
ACTION OF INDEBITATUS ASSUMPSIT 
351 

(1) The Count for Money Paid to the Defendant’s Use.—The theory underlying this Count is that where one 
person allows or requests another to assume such a position 

that the latter may be and is compelled to discharge a legal liability of the former, the Law creates or implies a request of 
the former to the latter to make the payment, and a Promise to repay him thus 
Implied, and the liability thus created may be enforced by an action of Indebitatus Assumpsit. As indicated by the 
heading such an action is technically called an action for money paid by the plaintiff for the use of the 
defendant; and in order to maintain a Count for Money thus Paid, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show, first, a 
payment in money, and seeondly, such payment must have been paid at the defendant’s request. And money must 
actually have been paid; a security such as a bond, or even stock, is not sufficient,~ This Count will lie where a party 
has been compelled to pay a debt that another should have paid. Thus, where a member of a firm gave a Promissory 
Note, signed in the partnership name for a debt of his own, and his partner was compelled to pay it, it was held that the 
latter might recover from the former as for Money Paid to his use.” And the same rule applied where one of several 
sureties, or other joint debtors, pays the whole debt. In such case he is allowed to recover from each of the others his 


proportionate share; and a Request to Pay and a Promise to Pay are feigned, in order to entitle him to the remedy by 
an Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit.*? The

v. Wheeler, 118 Mass. 295 (1875); New York: Doremus v. 


same is also true where a surety pays the debt of his principal.” Where the money was illegally paid the Count will 
not lie.” 


(2) The Count for Money Had and Received.*—the theory of this Count is that whenever one person has received 
money to which another person, in justice and good conscience, is entitled, the Law creates or Implies a Promise by the 
former to pay it to the latter, and an Action of Assutnpsit will lie to enforce this liability on the basis of the Fictitious 
Promise.~~ The action is techSelden, 19 Johns. (N.Y.) 213 (1821); Pennsylvania: 

Steekel v. Stcekel, 28 Pa. 233 (1857). 


Where several persons agree to contribute equally to certain expenditures, and one advances more than his share, the excess is so much paid 
for the use of the others and hence may be recovered in Indebitatus Assumpsit. Buck-master v. Grundy, 3 Gil. (IIl.) 626 (1840). Cf. Cram v. 
Hutehinson, 8 TILApp. 179 (1880).

And to establish a loan requires something more than a mere showing of a payment of money by the plaintiff; this 
alone raises a presumption of Law that such payment was in discharge of the debt and not by way of a loan.” Of 
course such presumption is rebuttable by showing transactions between the parties from which a loan may be 
inferred.” And naturally a Bill or a Note in the usual form will serve as evidence of money lent between the payee and 
drawer of the former, and the payee and maker of the latter”? 


(4) The Count for Interest Due.—The Common-Law rule as to when interest was 

allowed was stated by Chief Justice Abbott in the case of Higgins v. Bargent,~~ decided in 1823, where he declared: 
“Tt is now established as a general principle, that interest is allowed by law only upon mercantile securities, or in 
those cases where there has been an express promise to pay interest, or where such promise is to be implied from the 
usage of trade or other circUmstances.” oo There were some instances, however, not within the 


scope of the statement above, where interest was allowed, as where money was awarded to be paid on a 
day certain, if the money had been demanded, provided the plaintiff pro-

general not recoverable. 


By a Series of Statutes, however, the Common-Law rules as to the allowance of interest have been considerably 
altered. This began with the Statute of 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 42, 73 Statutes at Large 280, enacted in 1833. 


Section 28 provided that upon all debts or sums certain payable at a certain time or otherwise, the Jury (on the 
Trial or Inquiry) may allow interest, at a rate not exceeding the current rate, from the time when such debts 
or sums certain were payable, if such debts or sums be payable by virtue of some written instrument at a certain 
time; or if payable otherwise, then from the time when demand of payment shall have been made in writing, so as 
such demand shall give notice to the debtor that interest will be claimed front the date of such demand until the term 
of payment, provided that interest shall be payable in all cases in which it is now payable by law. 


Section 29 provided that the Jury on the Trial or Inquiry may give Damages in the nature of interest over and 
above the value of the goods at the time of the conversion or seizure in all Actions of Trover or Trespass Dc 


Bonis Aspo-rtatis, arid over and above the money recoverable in all actions on policies of assurance made after 
the passing of the act. 


Section 30 provided that if on Writ of 
Error the Judgment be for the defendant, the 
Court shall allow interest for such time as the 
execution has been delayed by the Writ of 
Error.

(5) The Count For Money Found to be Due on Account Statect—As this Count appears as the third major 
classification in The Classification of the Common Counts, it will be discussed below at that point, and not as one 
of the Indebitatus Counts, although it meets the requirements of an Indebitatus Count in the legal theory. 


(B) Other Counts: (1) The Count for Use and Occupation of LandP—At Common Law the Action of 
Indebitatus Assumpsit was not available for Use and Occupation upon a quasi-contract.~ The reason for this as 
worked out by Dean James Barr Ames, was connected with the nature of rent. On a lease for years, reserving a rent, 
as well as on a sale of goods, originally Debt was the only remedy. In both cases the Obligation to Pay did not arise 
out of a Contract in the modern sense, as Debt for goods sold was based on the

theory of a grant,”* whereas Debt for rent was a reservation. As to the sale of goods, the situation was altered by the 
development of Assumpsit, under which Assumpsit was extended into the Field of Debt, first, by holding that 
Assumpsit would lie where a Promise to Pay a Debt was made subsequent to the time when the Debt was created, 
and second, by the holding in 1602 in Blade’s Case,” in which it was decided “that the buyer’s words of 
agreement, which had before operated only as a grant, imported also a Promise, so that the seller might, without 
more, sue in Debt or Assumpsit, at his option.” 67 


But the courts refused to take this step in the case of rent, and apparently there was only one case :- of Indebitatus 
Assumpsit for rent prior to legislative intervention. In that case, Black v. Bowsat,°° decided in 1623, the reporter 
observed: “Note, there was not any exception taken, that the assumpsit is to pay a sum for rent; which is a real and 
special duty, as strong as upon a Specialty; and in such case this action lies not, without some Special Cause of 
Promise.” -- And Dean Ames cites cases to support the view that thereafter the plaintiff failed to recover in 
Assumpsit, both where there was a subsequent Express Promise to Pay, as well as where there was no such 
Promise. 


Assumpsit was made concurrent with Debt in order to evade Trial by Wager of Law, but

this incentive was lacking in the case of rent, as Wager of Law was not available in Debt for Rent. And the 
Executor of a Lessee was chargeable in Debt, while only Assumpsit was permitted against the Executor of a Buyer 
or Borrower. Hence, as Dean Ames suggests, the Courts found no reason why they should extend Indebitatus 
Assumpsit into the Field of Rent. In time, however, the landlord was permitted in certain cases to sue in Special 
Assumpsit as well as Debt, an innovation brought about by the continuing struggle between the Royal Courts for 
Jurisdiction. As Special Assumpsit was a 

branch of Trespass on the Case, over which King’s Bench had jurisdiction, this part of its jurisdiction was expanded to 
cover the situation, as it had no jurisdiction over cases arising by Original Writ in Debt. In 
its earliest attempt, as in the case of Synwock v. Payn,” the Court sought to justify its usurpation by construing 
agreements concerning leases as not creating a rent. In 1635, in the case of Acton v. Bimonds,’7’ it was 
held that Assumpsit would lie concurrently with Debt where it appeared that at the time of the lease, the lessee had 
expressly Promised to Pay the rent. The argument was summari2ed in a report of the same case in Rolle’s 
Abridgment,” where it was said: 

“The action lay, because it appeared that it was intended by the parties that a lease should be made and a rent 
reserved, and for better security of payment thereof that the lessor should have his remedy by Action of Debt upon 
the reservation, or Action upon this Collateral Promise at his Election, and this being the intent at the beginning, 
the making of the lease though real would not toll this Collateral Promise, as a man may covenant to accept a lease 
at a certain rent and to pay the rent according to the reserva~ tion, for they are two things, and so the

Promise of Payment is a thing Collateral to the Reservation, which will continue though the lessee assign over.” 
According to Dean Ames, this doctrine, as recognized by the Court of King’s Bench, was adopted by the Court of 
Exchequer in the case of Trever v. Roberts,” decided in 1664, and by the Court of Common Bench in the case of 
Johnson v. May,” decided in 1683. In the cases considered to this point the assumpsit was for the payment of a 
sum certain, but anumpsit was also admissible in cases where the amount to be recovered was uncertain, that is, 
where the defendant promised to pay a reasonable compensation for use and occupation of land. And, as Debt 
originally would not lie upon a Quantum Meruit Count,” Assumpsit thus filled a gap in the remedial law, as it lay 
where the sum to be recovered was indefinite or uncertain,~ with the consequence that Debt would not lie. 


Against this background, in the year 1737, the Statute of 11 Ceo. If, c. 19, was enacted. To remedy the 
inconvenience of suing for the recovery of rents, where the demises were not by deed, Section 14 provided that it 
shall be lawful for a landlord, “where the agreement is not by deed, to recover a reasonable satisfaction for the 
lands, tenements, and hereditaments held or occupied by the defendant in an Action on the Case for the Use and 
Occupation of what was so held or enjoyed; and if, in evidence on the Trial of such action, any 
parol or demise or agreement, not being by deed, whereon a certain rent was reserved, shall appear, the plaintiff shall 
not therefore be Non-suited, but may make use thereof as an evidence of the Quantum of Damages to be recovered.” 
From the language of the Statute, it is evident that it was

designed to eliminate two earlier difficulties which barred the use of Indebitatus Assumpsit for 
Use and Occupation; first, to prevent a plaintiff from being Non-Suited on the ground of a Variance, where the plaintiff 
had sued upon a Quantum Meruit Count, and it appeared from the evidence that the demise was for a sum certain, for 
which Debt was the proper remedy; and second, to escape from the necessity of proving an 
Express Promise at the time of the demise, where the plaintiff declared for a sum certain, and it was the 
removal of this second difficulty which gave the Statute its chief significance. Dean Ames summed up 
the matter, when he declared: “Thereby Indebitatus Ass’umpsit became concurrent with Debt upon all Parol 
Demises. In other words, the Statute gave to the landlord, in 1738, what Blade’s Case gave to the seller of goods, 
the lender of money, or the employee, in 1602; namely, the right to sue in Assumpsit as well as in Debt, without 
proof of an Independent Express Promise.” ~ 


Although the Statute only mentioned an Action on the Case, which meant Assumpsit, Debt for Use and 
Occupation still remained available,” even where there was an Express Demise, but not by deed.” Thus, the action of 
Indebitatus Assumpsit for Use and Occupation became a remedy in all those cases in which the demise or agreement was 
not by deed, and where the defendant had had an actual or constructive occupation; but 
where the demise or agreement was by deed, the action would not lie, in which case the remedy 
was in Debt or Covenant on the demise or agreement.”

ACTION OF INDEBITATUS ASSUMPSLT 


Page 374 of 735 


357 
As the Action for Use and Occupation was based on the landlord-tenant relationship, express or implied, and as 
the Statute was construed as limited to cases, where by mutual agreement, the person in possession of the land was 
to pay either a sum certain or a reasonable compensation to the owner, it was not possible to charge a trespasser 
in Assumpsit for Use and Occupation. 


As to pleading, it was not necessary to allege where the premises were located, as the Venue was Transitory.’ 
And where a rent had been agreed upon, that was the Measure of Damages, even though 
the lease was void,°' otherwise they would be the value of the premises, which should be proved.~ It was 
not permissible to join a Count on a Demise and a Count for Use and Occupation. *° 


(2) The Count for Board and Lodging.— In this Count the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was indebted for 
certain rooms, apartments and furniture, used and enjoyed 

at the special request of the said defendant; and for meat, drink, fire and candles, and other necessaries, found and 
provided by the plaintiff at the defendant’s special request; that the said defendant undertook and faithfully 
promised the plaintiff to pay him so much money as he reasonably deserved to have of the said defendant; plus an 
averment as to the amount of money the plaintiff reasonably deserved, 


(3) The Count for Land Sold and Conveyed.—The Indebitatus Counts include a Count for Real Property Sold. It 
has been held in many cases, that where the agreement to pay the price of Land was to pay the same in money, such 
price could be recovered un

der a General Indebitatus Count for Land Sold and Conveyed.” 


(4) The Count for Goods Sold and Dclivered.—The Indebitatus Count for Goods Sold and Delivered lies only 
where there has been a delivery of the goods to the defendant, or something equivalent toa delivery, as for 
instance, putting it within the defendant’s power to take them himself.” And whenever goods are 
sold and delivered under a Special Contract fixing the price to be paid, the action to recover the price is either Special 
Assumpsit on the Contract or the price of the goods, which the Law Implies to be their Value, may be recovered in 
General Assumpsit. But where the debt is not due from the defendant immediately, a Count for Goods Sold and 
Delivered will not lie and the action must be Special Assumpsit. But where there has been a delivery, the action may 
be either in Indebitatus Assumpsit, on the Count for Goods Sold and Delivered, or on a Quantum Valebant 
Count.”

his assent, no property passes, and Goods Bargained and Sold will not lie.” 


(6) The Count for Work, Labor and Services.—When work is done or services are rendered, not under a Special 

Contract as to compensation, but under such circumstances that the law will Imply a Promise to pay what they are 
worth, or where, though done or rendered under a Special Contract, that Contract has been Fully 
Performed, General Assumpsit will lie to recover compensation therefor. In such cases, the action may be in 
Indebitatus Assumpsit,”? or on the Quantum MeruitY~ 
(II) Value Counts: (A) Quantum Meruit. 
—The first of the Vaiue Counts, Quantum Ikteruit, is used where the plaintiff has performed services, and he 
alleges that, in Consideration that the plaintiff, at the request of the defendant had done certain 
work, he, the defendant, Promised the plaintiff to Pay him so much money as he there for reasonably 
deserved to have, and that the plaintiff deserved to have a certain sumY’

(B) Quantum Valebant..—The second of the Value Counts, Quantum Valebant, is used where the plaintiff has 
sold goods to the defendant, and he alleges that the defendant, in Consideration thereof, Promised the plaintiff to 
Pay him so much as the goods were reasonably worth, and that they were reasonably worth a certain sumY~ 


(C) The Absorption of the Quantum Mentit and Quantum Valebant Counts into the Indebitatus Counts.— 
As Debt originally lay for a sum certain only, that action could not be maintained 
on the facts of a Quantum Meruit or a Quantum Vatebant, because of the uncertainty of 
the sum involved. But when Debt was extended to suchjmplied Obligations, under the maxim Jd certum 
efl quocl certum reddi potest [that is certain which can be made certain], and the Indebitatus Count in Assumpsit 
came to be perniitted in cases where by evidence an uncertain sum could be reduced to a certainty, it thus was made 
possible to maintain the action on such factual situations as formerly required the use of the Quantum Meruit or 
Quantum Valebant Counts. The Value Counts of Quantum Meruit and Quantum Valebant, in the eyes of 
the legal profession in England, came to be regarded as unnecessary, their original scope and purpose being 
brought within the purview of the Indebitatus Count in Assurnpsit and in Debt. In

recognition of this fact the Regulations of Trinity Term, in 1831, prescribed a Common Form 
for the Common Counts of Indebitatus Assumpsit and Account Stated, simplifying and relieving them from “un- 
necessary verbiage.” ~- 


In the United States it has been held that 
the use of the Value Counts is now not necessary, since the reasonable Value of Goods Sold and Delivered or Work 
and Labor Done may

be recovered upon an Indebitatus Count.t Thus, in Parker v. Macamber,” where the plaintiff brought Indebitatus 
Assumpsit to recover compensation for board, maintenance, care and nursing, with the Declaration containing Four 
Counts, for Goods Sold and Delivered, Work and Labor, Money Had and Received, and for Interest, and the Jury re- 
turned a Verdict for the plaintiff, after which the defendant sought a New Trial, contend- 
ing, among other things, that the evidence as to the services rendered was not admissible without a Quantum Meruit 
Count, the Court denied a New Trial, declaring: “We think it [the declaration] is sufficient. A Count 
in Quantum Mcmii, as well as one in Intl ebitat us Assumpsit for Work, Labor, Skill, Care, Diligence, etc., claims a 
certain sum due. In either case the plaintiff may recover less, and the Judgment is for so much of his stated claim 
as is found to be justly merited. The Counts in Quantum Meruit and Quantum Valebat, are 
therefore unnecessary in any case.” ~ 


The effect of such decisions has been to reduce the necessary Common Counts to the indebitatus 
Counts and the Account Stated, the latter of which will now be considered. 


(111) The Common Count on an Account &ated.’—The Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit lies to recover the 
balance due upon an Account Stated, for the law Implies a Promise to pay it. The Account Stated must be with 
reference to former transactions between the parties, or some debt for which an action or suit would lie, or some 
demand which the defendant ought morally and in

justice to pay; if not, the Count is not maintainable. The rule as to when the Count on an Account Stated will lie, 
was laid down in the case of Porter v. Coaper, by Baron Parke, who declared: “I take the 
rule to be this, that if there is an admission of a sum of money being due for which an action would lie that 
will he evidence to go to the Jury on the Count for an Account Stated.”’ Thus, an Account Stated is an acknowledg- 
ment of debt.

LIARILIT1ES~ 


177. Indebitatus Assuznpsit will not lie, in the absence of a statute, to enforce a Domestic Judgment nor a 
Judgment rendered in a Sister State. But a Judgment of a Foreign Court is not considered a Debt of Record. 
Indehitatus Assumpsit will lie to enforce certain Statutory Obligations to pay money.

sit will lie depends on the character of the Judgment. Assumpsit will only 
lie on a Simple Contract, or a Quasi-Contractual Obligation having the force and effect of a Simple Contract 
Debt. It will not lie on a Contract under Seal, or on any other Specialty. A Judgment of a Court of 
Record, not being a Foreign Court, is not merely evidence of the debt, but is conclusive evidence of it. It is a 
Specialty, and therefore Indebitatus Assumpsit will not lie.” 


It was long ago determined, however, that the Judgment of a Foreign court is merely evidence of the debt, and 
not conclusive, so that it has only the force of a Simple Contract, and therefore Indebitatus Assumpsit may be 
maintained upon it.” The action will also lie on a Domestic Judgment of an Inferior Court Not of 
Record, since it is not a Specialty.’* Some of the Courts have therefore held 
that Indebitatus Assumpsit will lie on a Justice’s Judgment; but there are decisions to the contrary, on 
the ground that even a Justice’s Judgment is conclusive, and therefore a Snecialty.”*

It was at one time held in some states that the Judgment of a Court of Record in a Sister State is of the same

Constitution that a Judgment rendered in One State shall have the same force and validity in Every Other State as in 
the State in which it was renderedr a Judgment of a Court of Record of One State is conclusive evidence of the debt 
in Every Other State (except that it may be attacked for fraud or want of jurisdiction), and therefore a Specialty, and 
it necessarily follows that it will not support the action of Indehitatus Assumpsit. The remedy is Dcbt.’°

(ID A Promise by the Defendant to Pay 
Money. 
(III) A Breach of the Promise. 
(IV) The Damages. 
THE Form of the Declaration in Indebitatus (General) Assumpsit is very simple, and needs scarcely any 
discussion. The chief difficulty is in determining when General Assumpsit will lie. Instead of stating the concrete 
facts of the cause of action, the Corn

mon Counts state only General Conclusions of Law, as that defendant is indebted for money had and received, or 
some other vague reason. These General Statements do not disclose the exact ground of the liability, or assist in 
presenting the Issue of Law and Fact on which the case depends. They are convenient in avoiding the danger of a 
Variance and concealing the real basis of the claim, but violate the true principles and policies of pleading.’

179. The Declaration must allege an Existing Indebtedness to the plaintiff, based on a receipt of value by 
him, at his request. 


Indebitatvs Assunipsit 

AS we have stated previously, in stating 
the debt and its cause in the Common Counts in Indebitatus Assumpsit, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant, on a 
certain day, at a certain place, was indebted for a sum certain, for a Specific Consideration furnished by the plaintiff, 
with a Statement that the Consideration was furnished at the Special Instance and Request of the defendant’? Time 
and

place are in generai immaterial, except that a time must not be laid subsequent to the date when the Cause of Action 
arose; — and with regard to place, if the action is brought in a Court of Inferior Jurisdiction, the Declaration should 
allege that the Cause of Action arose within such ,Jurisdiction.”' The statement of the sum claimed is also, generally, 
immaterial except that enough must be laid to cover the actual amount, Another requisite is the statement of the 
Cause of the Debt, as well as the debt itself; and this is both for the information of the defendant, so that he may 
know what debt is sued on and what defense to make, and in order to identify the subject-matter of the action, so 
as to enable him to Plead the Recovery in Bar of any subsequent action for the same debt.” As this Form of Action 
is founded upon Contract, the cause or consideration of the debt should be stated as having taken place or as 
having been furnished at the Special Instance and Request of tile defendant.”

The statement that money was ‘lent” Implies that it was advanced at the request of the defendant But 
Quantum Meruit and Quantum Valebant Counts 

IN the Quantum Meruit Count the plaintiff declares that, in Consideration of his has’ing performed some 
personal service for the defendant, at his Request, the latter Promised to pay him so much therefor as he reasonably 
deserved, and then states how much he deserves for such service,” 


In the Quantum Valebant Count the plaintiff declares that, in Consideration of his having Sold and Delivered real 
or personal property to the defendant at his Request, he Promised to pay him so much as the goods or land were 
reasonably worth, and then states what the value was. There is no necessity for using the Value or Quantum Counts 
rather than the Indebitatus Counts to recover for what one’s goods or services are reasonably worth.2° 


In these Counts it is not sufficient to state merely that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum, 
and Promised payment, but it must be shown what was the cause or subject-matter or nature of the debt; 


this does not apply to money “paid”. English: Victors v. Davies, 12 M. & W. 758, 152 Eng.Rep. 1405 (1844); West Virginia: Somerville v.

as that it was for work done, or goods sold, etc.” But it is not necessary to state the particular description of the 
work done, or goods sold, etc., for the only reason why the plaintiff is bound to show in what respect the defendant 
is indebted is that it may appear to the Court that it is not a Specialty.”! 


Account Stated 

IT is usual, in Actions of General Assumpsit, to add, to the Counts above mentioned, a statement of a Cause of 
Action alleging that the defendant accounted with the plaintiff, and that, upon such accounting, the defendant was 
found to be indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum.” As the Consideration for the Promise is here the statement of 
the account ascertaining and fixing the sums due which constitute the debt, and not the existence of the debt itself,

DECLARATION IN INDEHITATUS AS 
SUMPSIT—ESSENTIAL ALLEGA 
TIONS: (3) THE PROMISE 


180. The Promise of the Defendant, though it is an Implied One, must always be alleged. 


IT is not intended by this that there must be a detailed statement of the defendant’s Contract, but a brief 
Allegation that the defendant “Promised” or “Agreed” to pay the sum owed or value claimed. This much is held 
essential to a proper statement of the Cause of Action, as the Declaration might otherwise show the rWeged 
Consideration to be merely a voluntary or gratuitous act on the part of the plaintiff, for which there could be no 
recovery.” It does not make any difference whether the defendant ever made any such Promise, nor is it necessary to 
prove 
it. All that is necessary to prove is a debt, and the law Implies a Promise. Eut some Courts will reverse a case on 
this technical matter.”

of the defendant to perform it, that is, to pay. 
As in Special Assumpsit, it is an essential part of the cause of action, and must in all cases be stated, 

THE neglect or refusal of the defendant to fulfill his Promise, whether Express or Implied, is always a necessary 
Allegation in the Declaration, as it is essential to the plaintiff’ s right to sue, In form it is usually a brief statement 
that the defendant has neglected and refused to pay, and still neglects and refuses so to do. This is the Common 
Breach usually Assigned in Actions upon the Common Counts, and a Separate Breach is always Assigned to Each 
Count, as each is a separate and complete statement of a cause of action?”

TIONS: (5) THE DAMAGES 


182. The Declaration must allege the Damages directly resulting from the Breach by the defendant, and 
must lay them high enough to cover the actual demand. 


THE measure of recovery in this action will obviously be the amount of the indebtedness due, or the reasonable 
worth and value of the services rendered or goods or land sold, where no sum was agreed upon; and the Damages 
must always be laid high enough to cover all the plaintiff expects to prove, as his recovery will be limited to the 
amount stated.”

sumpsit, covering the period from its origin until now, shows that the action is still operating with its earlier 
vitality substantially unimpaired. 


THE Action of Indebitatus (General) Assumpsit was in general use in the several states of the United States 
prior to 1848?~ After 1848, the action remained in vogue. Thus, for example, in the Rhode Jsland case of Parker v. 
Macomber) °° decided in 1892, in which the plaintiff brought Indebitatus Assumpsit for Goods Sold and Delivered, 
Work and Labor, Money Had and Received, and for Interest, and the Jury returned a Verdict for the plaintiff and 
assessed Damages at $1,072.50, being at a certain rate for 390 weeks, and the defendant prayed for a New Trial, 
contending, among other things, that the services were performed under an Entire Contract, which had not been 
completed, the Court denied a New Trial. In so doing, Douglas, J. declared: 


“The questions which are raised by the petition are, whether the plaintiff can recover what his services are 


reasonably worth, notwithstanding the making of the Contract, and, if so, whether this Declaration is sufficient 
without a Count in Quantum Meruit to admit evidence of the value of the services, and to sustain a Judgment 


Page 384 of 735 


therefor. 


“We cannot doubt that, when this action was brought, the agreement had been annulled, if it ever had had any 
validity. 


“If the leasehold interest were for a term exceeding one year, the agreement amounted to an attempt to convey an 
interest in real estate by parol, and was void under the Statute of Frauds.

entitled to re— cover the value of his services already rendered. Lockwood v. Barnes, 3 Hill, N.Y. 128; King v. 
Welcome, 5 Gray. 41.” ~ 


In New York case of City of New York v. Fink, 31 decided in 1927, the issue was raised as to whether, under the 
Code, an action would lie against a trespasser to land for the reasonable value of the Use and Occupation thereof? In 
denying a Motion by the defendant, under Rule 112 of the Rules of Civil Practice, for Judgment on the Pleadings, 
McGoldrick, J. said: 

“As a Development of the Common Law a party was permitted to bring an Action of Assumpsit and thus avoid 
the difficulties presented in the Pleading and Proof of Causes of Action in Covenant, Debt and the like. The remedy, 
however, was not extended to a case in which the landlord sought to recover compensation for the use of his land, 
not reserved by deed, until the enactment of statutes (see 11 George II, chap. 19, § 14), in substance re-enacted in 
our Revised Statutes and contained in Section 220 of our Real Property Law. When it is said, therefore, that to 
maintain Use and Occupation the conventional relation must exist, and such action cannot be maintained against a 
trespasser (Prof. Ames “Assumpsit for Use and Occupation,” 2 Harv.L.R. 377; Keener Quasi Contracts, 191, 
192), this merely means that the Form of Action characterized as Assumpsit and based upon the existence of the 
conventional relation of landlord and tenant could not be maintained against one not bound expressly or impliedly as 
tenant, or against a trespasser. 

“It would seem to follow that the historical reasons which prevented an owner of property from recovering

BA. 858, 800 (1892).

pass unless he had procured a Judgment [in Ejectment] against the wrongdoer no longer exists for the apparent 
object of the legislation was not that compensation for trespass could only be had in an action to recover the 
property or the possession thereof, but to remedy a condition which made it necessary for a plaintiff in Ejectment to 
institute, after Judgment, a separate proceeding for the collection of his Damages.” ~ 


In view of the Abolition of the Forms of Actions by the Codes, an issue was bound to arise as to whether the 
summary method of statement of a cause of action, as found in the Action of General Assunipsit, could be used 
under the Codes. Dean Pomeroy held to the position that in the face of the Code requirement that the Complaint 
should state the facts in plain and concise language, the practice of using the Common Counts in Indebitatus 
Assumpsit violated one of the fundamental objectives of the Codes.~ “But” said Judge Clark, “the Common Counts 
were apparently too well and favorably known and too convenient a form of pleading to succumb to this strenuous 
attack, for in probably all Jurisdictions the use of the Common Counts, at least for an indebtedness incurred with the 
defendant’s consent, is well settled.” ao 


Judge Clark’s view finds confirmation in the New York case of Maxherntan Co. Inc. v. Aiper)’ decided in 1924.

special instance and request, was held suff icient on Motion by the defendants for Judgment on the Pleadings, even 
though a Bill of Particulars showed that the defendants had secured the goods from third persons on an alleged 
purchase, but with knowledge that the third persons had no title to the goods. Said the Court: 

“While it seems to me that every Complaint should state facts giving rise to a Cause of Action, complaints in the 
Common-Law Form have been sustained since the enactment of the Civil Practice Act. Such being the case, I cannot 
distinguish the Complaint in the case at Bar, supported as it is by the Bill of Particulars, from the Complaints in 
numerous other adjudicated cases.” 42 


Finally, in the Federal case of Stone v. White,*’ decided in 1937, in which the plaintiff brought a statutory action 
for a refund

of taxes erroneously collected, the Supreme Court of the United States sustained the plaintiff, Mr. Justice Stone 
observing: 

“The action, brought to recover a tax erroneously paid, although an action at law, is equitable in its function. It is 
the lineal successor of the Common Count in Indebitafits Assumpsit for Money Had and Received. Originally an 
action for the recovery of debt, favored because more convenient and flexible than the Common Law Action of 
Debt, it has been gradually expanded as a medium for recovery -upon every Form of Quasi-Contractual Obligation 
in which the duty to pay money is Imposed by Law, independently of Contract, Express or Implied in Fact.” 4 


It thus appears that the Common-Law Action of Indebitatus (General) Assumpsit is still operating with its earlier 
vitality substantially unimpaired, despite our Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court.

DEMAND OF OYEIZ' 


184. The Demand of Oyer is the Assertion of the Right of a Patty to hear read (Oyer), or, in Modern Practice, 
to inspect, a deed of which Profert is made by the Other Party in his Pleading. 


IF the Declaration contained Profert of an Instrument under Seal, upon which the plaintiff grounded his Right of 
Action, the first steps of the defendant, after its receipt, was a Demand of Oyer; that is, the Right to

Actions, c. II, Of the Proceedings in an Action, from its Commencement to its Termination, 100—104 (3rd Am. ed. by Tyler, 
Washington, B. C. 1898); Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. VIII, Motions of Defendant After Declaration and

have the Instrument under Seal read, or in Modem Practice, to inspect it before Trial.” The opposite party is required 

to afford this inspection, either by permitting an inspection of the Instrument itself, or by showing or serving a copy. 

It was necessary to have the Instrument read in Open Court, where the defendant desired to ascertain the authenticity 

of the Instrument, or to make use by Demurrer or Plea of such portions of the Document as were not set forth in the 

Deelaration. The effect of granting Oyer was to make the Instrument under Seal a Part of the Record. And the Right 

of Oyer existed in all the Common-Law Actions, whether Mixed, Personal or Real, and by its exercise, 


2. Rand v. Rand, 4 N.H. 267, 278 (1828); Judge of Probate v. Merrill, 6 N.H. 256 (1833). 


The right to crave Oyer of Papers mentioned in pleading applies only to Specialties and to Letters of Probate and 
Administration, not to other writings. It only applies to a deed when the party pleading relles upon the direct and Intrinsic 
operation of the deed, Smith r. Wolslofer, 110 Va. 247, 89 SE. 115 (1916).

the defendant was relieved from pleading until it was granted. It was also demandable in response to Profert made in 
any pleading subsequent to the Declaration? 


When a Deed is pleaded with Profert, it is supposed to remain in Court all the Term in which it is pleaded, but no 
longer, unless the opposite pa?ty during that Term plead in denial of the Deed, in which case it is supposed to 
remain in Court till the Action is determined. Hence, it is a Rule that Oyer cannot be demanded in a subsequent 
Term to that in which profert is made.* 


A party having a Right to Demand Oyer is yet not obliged, in all cases, to exercise that right; nor is he obliged in 
all cases, after demanding it, to notice it in the pleading he afterwards files or delivers. Sometimes, however, he is 
obliged to do both, namely, where he has occasion to found his answer upon any matter contained in the Deed of 
which Profert is made, and not set

Motions of Defendant After Declaration and Before 
Plea, Art. I, Section 231, Demand of Os-er, 187 (St. 
Paul, 1905). 


Oyer could only be demanded where Profcrt is made. Thus in an action on a bond conditioned for performance of the covenant in another deed, 
the defendant cannot crave Oyer of such deed, but must himself plead it with a Profert. Perry, Common-Law Pleading: Its History and

Termiaation, 102 (3rd Am. ed. by Tyler, Washington, D. C. 1893). 


According to the settled Conunon-Law Rule of Practice in this State, the same not having been abrogated or altered by statute, Oyer of a bond de- 
clared on cannot be craved after the First Term succeeding the final proceeding at rules, or after the defendant has- pleaded, or a Rule to Plead 
has expired, as thereafter presumably the bond is not in Court. County Court of Erooke County v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., ST 
W.V. 504. 105 SE. 787 (1021). 


Os-er must precede defensive matter whether it be by Demurrer or Plea, Id. 
forth by his adversary. In such cases the only admissible method of making such matter appear to the Court is to 
Demand Oyer, and from the copy given, set forth the whole deed verbatim in his pleading.” 


In Pleading Performance, for example, of the condition of a Bond, where, as is generally the case, the plaintiff in 
his Declaration has stated nothing but the Bond itself, without the condition, it is essential for the defendant to 
Demand Oyer of the condition and then set it forth. And in pleading Performance of Matters contained in a Collat- 
eral Instrument, it is necessary not only to do this, but it is also essential to set forth and make Profert of the whole 
substance of the Collateral Instrument; otherwise it would not appear that the Instrument did not stipulate for the 
Performance of negative or disjunctive matters; and, in that case, the General Plea of Performance of the Matters 
therein contained, as shown above, would be improper. 


According to Martin, Oyer was not demandable of a Record Recognizance, Private Act of Parliament, Letters 
Patent, Agreement, Note, or other Instrument not Under Seal. It was anciently rllowed of the Orig

VIEWS, AID-PRAYER AND VOUCHER 
TO WARRANTY 


185. Preliminary to making a Defense in the Ancient Real Actions, a defendant might seek a View of the 
Land to better formulate his Defense, an Aid-Prayer, or a call for assistance in pleading, and a Voucher to 
Warranty, or a call to some other person to answer the action. 


Views, Aid-Prayer and Voucher to Warranty IN the Ancient Real Actions, now obsolete to all practical intents 
and purposes, there were certain motions available to the defendant as a preliminary to making his Defense. A mere 
enumeration and definition of these early procedural devices will suffice. 


In Suits by a Demandant to recover land, the tenant, in certain of the Real Actions was permitted to Demand a 
View of the Land in dispute. The purposes of such Demand was that he might know with some certainty what 
specific land the plaintiff sought to re cover. Such knowledge enabled him to properly shape his Defense.° 


Where the tenant felt that his own estate was weak, he might, as was said Pray in Aid or call for the assistance of 
another to assist him in pleading. Such a motion might be made by the life tenant, asking that the owner of the 
inheritance in reversion or in renaainder be joined with him, or that he should assist in defending the title.’°

By Voucher to Warranty is meant the calling in of some person to respond to the Action, who has warranted the 
title to the tenant who has been sued. If and when the Vouchee put in an appearance, he was substituted as the 
defendant in place of the Vouching Tenant.” 


IMPARLANCE 


Page 389 of 735 


186. After the plaintiff had filed his Jeclaration, the defendant was entitled to time within which he might 
confer with his Adversary, with a view to an amicable settlement. The delay thus permitted was called an 
Imparlance, and the word Impariance came to be applied to the time given to either party in responding to 
his adversary’s pleading. 


AFTER the defendant put in an Appearance, he was entitled to the indulgence of the Court, to some delay, before 
responding to the Declaration. This privilege was known as an Imparlance, taken from the French “parler”, meaning 
to speak. Martin says that in the Primitive or Oral Period of Pleading, it signified a Jeave to confer with the opposite 
party, with a view to an amicable settlement of the controversy.”” Jn order to accomplish this end time was required, 
and, as a result, the word itself came to represent the time given by the Court to either Party to respond to the 
pleading of his opponent.’* Imparlances were of Three Kinds:

(1) General; (2) Special: and (3) General Special.” 


A Genera! Imparlance is a delay granted by the Court in response to a General Prayer for leave to imparl, without 
the saving of any exceptions. If leave was granted, the party obtaining it could plead only in Bar of the Action; he 
could plead neither in Abatement, nor to the Jurisdiction of the Court. He was also precluded from pleading a Ten- 
der, claim of Conusance, or Demanding Oyer of a Deed. According to Martin, this Tm-parlance, which was 
customarily granted, came to be entered by the attorneys as a matter of course, and operated as a Continuance of the 
Cause to the Next Term?” 


A Special Imparlance was granted in response to a prayer for an Imparlance which reserved the right to 
make Dilatory Pleas in Abatement to the Writ, Bill, or Count, but not to the Jurisdiction of the Court, unless 
the Pleas were grounded on a personal privilege.’° Such an Imparlance was granted only by leave of the Court 
of King’s Bench, or by the Court or Prothonotaries in the Court of Common Pleas, and its effect was to extend the 
time for pleading to some day during the same Term or to the first four days of the next Term.'” 


A General Special Imparlance was distinguished from the foregoing Imparlances, in that it secured to the 
applicant the right to make any exceptions to the Bill, Declaration or Writ. It was available only by leave 
of Court, and it operated as a Continuance in the same manner as in Special Imparlances. 


The effect of Imparlances was generally to extend the time of pleading to the next Term, or some later Term.

ASSUMING the plaintiff has filed a Declaration in a Common Law Action which contains a General Allegation, 
how could the defendant compel the plaintiff to make his General Charge specific? The answer is

that he might accomplish this end by moving for a Bill of Particulars. The Procedural Device known as a Bill 
of Particulars enabled a defendant to ascertain the details of the plaintiff's claim. The mere 
naming of this Device raises two questions; one, as to its Origin, two, as to its Scope and Application. 


As to its Origin, it may be said that its development was late in point of time. No satisfactory explanation of this 
has been given, but it is surmised that the Origin of the Bill of Particulars is connected with 
the fact that the early Common Law employed a System of Oral Pleading, which, unlike Modern Pleading, was 
conducted in Open Court in advance of the Triai by the Parties or their Counsel by word of mouth. Since the 
Pleading took place Orally in the presence of the Court, the Judge could direct each Stage of the Pleadings 


and compel the Parties to reach an Issue on which both parties were prepared 
to stand. 


Thus, to illustrate, let us suppose that A, in stating his case, alleged that B took his horse, whereupon B 
inquired, what horse? Thereupon, the Judge required A to specify what horse, to wit, a black horse, with 
a white forefront foot. The plaintiff s Allegation having been made Specific, the defendant B might object that A’s 
case was insufficient in Law, he might deny the plaintiff’s charge, or he might seek to avoid 
the alleged liability by admitting the taking of the horse, and then offer the excuse that he took 
the horse under an Execution. Assuming B admitted the taking and offered the excuse that he took the 


horse under an Execution, the Judge could turn to the plaintiff, A, and say, how about this? If A 
traversed B's Plea, an Issue of Fact was raised as to whether B took the horse in Execution; if A Demurred to B’s 
Plea, an Issue of Law was raised as to whether the taking by Execution was a legally sufficient 


excuse. At each stage of this Oral Altercation, during the early Developmental Period of Pleading, the Court was 
Sec. 187 


AFTER THE DECLARATION AND BEFORE THE PLEA 


Page 391 of 735 


0~70 


available to rule at once as to the validity of the plaintiff’s Statement of his Cause of 
Action or the defendant’s Statement of his Defence. Thus, if the plaintiff’ s Allegation was too general, and the 
defendant objected, the Court could compel the plaintiff then and there to make his Declaration more 
specific, and so, likewise, the Court could compel the defendant to make his Defence more specific if the 
defendant was too general in setting forth his Defence. By permitting the Parties to restate their positions to meet 
with the Court’s ideas, by a process of free Amendment, the Parties were directed in the 
development of an Issue of Fact or of Law which fairly presented the ground upon which the Parties were prepared 
to conduct their part of the action. If the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Law, the Trial was heard by the 
Court; if they ended in an Issue of Fact, the Trial was had according to some one of the established 
ModS of Trial. Whether the Issue was one of Law or of Fact, the intervention of a Bill of Particulars was 
not necessary to bring the parties to Issue or to Judgment. 


But the whole picture changed when Litigation in Person with the Pleader serving as his own mouthpiece was 
changed to Litigation by Attorney, who, according to the practice of the Court, was now required to commit his 
instructions to writing. So reduced to writing, the Prothonotary, an Officer of the Court, recorded 
them on a Parchment Roll.” It is not known when the pleading was first required to be written, but 
Holdsworth suggests a ease which arose during the Reign of Henry VI (1422—1461) as involving “perhaps the first 
and certainly an early mention of a ‘paper’ pleading.” 2 The first departure probably took place 
when the Parties or their Counsel Entered the Pro- 


21.3 Ilolds~vortli, History of English Law, e. VI, Proced,,ro and Pleading, 043—644 (4th ed. London 1035). 

ceedings on the Roll,” but in time this gave way to the later practice of putting the Pleadings in Writing at once. 
Whatever the reason for this transition, the change had a profound effect upon the Issue-Making Funclion 
of Pleading. According to Simpson,” “Technicality developed; ease of Amendment disappeared; most important of 
all, the Pleading Stage of a Common-Law cause ceased to be conducted in the 
presence of the Court and became a matter for the Parties and their Lawyers alone except 
where the Court’s decision on the issues as developed between unsupervised counsel was required.” 


Thus, reverting to our hypothetical case, suppose that A under the new regime, files a Written 
Declaration containing a General Allegation that B took his horse. B wants to know what horse? 
Since the parties are no longer pleading Orally before an Open Court, the question naturally arose as to how B could 
compel A to make his General Allegation more specific? It was this predicament which the defendant found himself 
in, which gave rise to the demand for the development of some form of procedural device by 
which he could compel the plaintiff to make a General Charge in his Declaration specific. 


And the procedural device developed to meet this situation came to be known as a Billof 
Particulars. Apparently it made its first appearance in criminal prosecutions, such as an indictment for

in the case of Le Breton v. Braham,” in which the defendant in an Action of Assumpsit offered to pay the 
plaintiffs claim when ascertained, Lord Mansfield granted a Bill of Particulars. And Tidd” 
observed that where it appeared by reference to the Bill of Particulars that some Counts were 
superfluous, the Court would expunge the superfluous Counts.*° 


By 1802, as illustrated by the case of Gellett v. Thompson,” the right of a defendant to Demand a Bill of 
Particulars, when the Declaration contained a General Allegation, had been firmly established. 


But as late as 1817, Chief Justice Gibbs, in Lovelock v. Cheveley,” referred to the practice of 
granting Bills of Particular as “almost a new system within the recollection of many of us.” ° 


It became the rule that in Actions of Indebitatus Assumpsit or in the Action of Debt for goods sold and 
delivered or work arid labor done, when the Declaration failed to disclose the particulars of 
the demand, as was usually the case, the defendant’s attorney might take out a Summons 
before a Judge requiring the plaintiff’ s attorney to show cause why he should not deliver to the defendant’s attorney 
in writing the particulars of the plaintiff's demand, for which the action was brought, and why, in the 
meantime, all proceedings should not be stayed.” Apparently such a rule to show cause could be 
taken out

before appearance in both King’s Bench and Common Pleas, so that the defendant might be advised of the 
full details of the demand, in order that he might pay it, if he so desired. 
In general, however, the rule was taken out after Appearance and the filing of the Declaration, 
but before the Plea. 


Once the Order for a Bill of Particulars had been granted, the plaintiff was required to 
deliver in writing a particular account of the items in the demand, with an explanation of how and when it arose. 
And where there has been an Account Current, both the credits and debits should be shown. And, 
of course, after the receipt of the particulars, the defendant once again was given time within 
which to plead, such time being regulated according to the Rules of the Court 
in which the case was pending. 


In the Actions of Covenant, Debt on Articles of Agreement, and Special 
Assumpsit, or in Actions on Matters of Record, according to Martin,” an Order for 
Particulars did not seem necessary. 


In Tort Actions, as the wrong complained of was usually stated in the Declaration with 
some certainty, an Order for Particulars was not often demanded; it might be, however, when the Nature of 
the Tort was of such a character as to make such an Order necessary and proper. 3° And, of course, 
where the Bill delivered was defective in that it failed to make full disclosure, a further 
Bill of Particulars might be obtained by Order of the Court. 


At Common Law, the plaintiff was entitled, at the Replication Stage ot’ 
Pleading, toan Order for a Bill of Particulars in the specific instance where the defendant 
entered a Plea of Set-Off for goods sold.”

If a Bill of Particulars was delivered by the plaintiff, it was incorporated into the Declaration containing the 
Cause of Action upon which it rested, and the effect was to exclude at the Trial the submission of any evidence 
outside of the particulars delivered. The effect was the same as to Pleas, where, by Statute, the Right to Demand 
Particulars has been extended to plaintiff s.”

Particulars continue to function and serve a useful purpose. On the other hand, the Tm-parlance, Views, Aid- 
Prayer, and Voucher of Warranty have ceased to function. 


OF’ the Six Procedural Devices which came After the Declaration and Before the Plea, four have become almost 
wholly obsolete, while two retain considerable vitality. The Irnparlance, Views, Aid-Prayer, and Voucher of 
Warranty, as previously indicated, have ceased to function, the Imparlance, by a process of construction, having 
been largely nullified~ by the Uniformity of Process Act -and by the Hilary Rules.*°

Guaranty Co,” decided in 1921, where one of the issues was as to the time when Oyer of a Bond could be craved, 
Lynch, J., of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals declared: “Thus there is presented the novel procedural 
question whether Oyer of a Sealed Instrument can rightly be demanded at any time after a Demurrer or Plea is 
tendered or filed. This question must be answered according to the procedure prescribed at Common Law, there 
being no abrogation, modification, or alteration of the Common-Law Rule in that respect by any Statute of this 
State. Under the Title, “Time to Demand,’ the author of the Chapter on Pleading, found in 31 Cyc., says, at page 
553: ‘It is the settled rule of Practice at Common Law that Oyer cannot be craved after the first term or after the Rule 
for Pleading has expired, since the Deed is not supposed to be in Court after that time; but it is demandable at any 
period before the time for Pleading is out, although that has been extended, unless the order except the right to 
Demand Oyer. Oyer must precede the Matter of Defense, whether that be by Plea or Demurrer, and regularly it 


should precede the entry of Imparlance’—the eQuivalent of a continuance.” ~

18 of the New Jersey Practice Act of 1912” provided that “Bills of Particulars may be ordered as heretofore.” And 
by Section 236 of the New Jersey Revised Laws of 
1877,~~ the right to have a Bill of Particulars was extended to the case where a plaintiff demands a Bill of 
Particulars of a defendant, provided he should, before Replication filed, demand in writing a Bill of Particulars. In 
this Action the defendant before Answer filed, demanded a Bill of Particulars, which was 
furnished. On August 13th the defendant notified the plaintiff of a Motion to be made on August 20th for a more 
Specific Bill of Particulars. The day following such notice the defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint, to which 
the plaintiff replied, thus bringing the Cause to an Issue. On hearing, the Court ordered a further Bill of Particulars. 
The plaintiff then moved to Vacate the Order. On appeal, the Courtheld that the Order requiring a 
further Bill of Particulars, after Answer filed, was improperly made and should be set aside. Rule 18 
therefore merely adopted the General Common-Law Rule that a Demand for a Bill of Particulars must be made 
before Answer filed.*° 


In Vacating the Order, Kalisch, 3., declared; “That a Demand for a Bill of Particulars must be made before 
Answer filed was the Common-Law Rule and Practice. 1 Tidd Pr. 642. The filing of a Plea was stayed until the 
Demand was complied with. If the Bill of Particulars was insufficient a Demand for a more specific Bill of 
Particulars could undoubtedly be made, and, if ordered, upon application to the Court, the Proceedings would be 


stayed until the Demand was complied with. «*The Practice in

this State was patterned after the Common Law. 


“By the fifty-fourth Section of the Act of 1799 (Pat.L., p. 361), it is provided: ‘That the plaintiff or his 
Attorney, if required, shall deliver to the defendant, or his Attorney, a copy of the Account, or a Bill of Particulars 
of the Demand, or a copy of the Bill, Bond, Deed, Bargain, Contract; Note, Instrument or other writing, whereon the 
Declaration is founded.’ 


“Tn the case of Clinton v. Lyon, 3 N.J,L. 1038, Hornblower, afterwards Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, 
who appeared forthe plaintiff, said; 


-Our Act on the subject of a Bill of Particulars, is not a New Law, but a confirmation of the Common Law, 
manifested by Universal Practice.’ * 


“And in a case under the title of Anony-mous, 16 N.1L. 346, Mr. Gifford moved for a rule 
that he have further time to plead, the Bill of Particulars not having been delivered till the 15th 
instant, and Mr. Chief Justice Hornblower said: 


“‘The rule is that the defendant has the same time for pleading, after 
receiving the Bill of Particulars, that he had at the time of demanding it. The delay in the delivery is 
not to be counted as part of his time for pleading.’ And in Tillou v. liutchinson, 15 N.J.L. 178, Mr. Chief 
Justice Hornblower (at p. 179) said: ‘By the fifty-fourth section of the Practice Act, Record 
Laws of 1821, page 421, the defendant, or his attorney, at any time before plea pleaded, has right to require, and the

plaintiff or his attorney, if required, is bound to deliver to the defendant, or his attorney, a copy of any bond, bill or 
note, on which the declaration is founded. If regularly required, the plaintiff, or his attorney, must deliver 
such copy, at his peril. But the requisition should appear to have been made ‘before plea pleaded,’ and 
in writing. Section-54, above referred to, is the same as found

in Pat.L., above referred to. The entire substance of this section is incorporated in section 236 of the 
Revision of 1877, page 885, with the extension to the case where a plaintiff demands a Bill of 
Particulars of a defendant he shall, before replication filed, demand, in writing, a Bill of Particulars, &c. 


“This section, in turn, became section 102 of the Practice Act of the Revision of 1903. 3 comp.Stat. p. 
4082. Under the new Practice Act (Pamph.L.1912, rule 18, p. 388), appended to the latter act, it is 
provided: ‘Bills af Particulars may be ordered as heretofore.’ This leaves the former statutes and practice thereunder 
undisturbed. Rules 32 and 94 of the Supreme Court accomplish no different result.” ~ 


Under Modem Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court, a Bill of Particulars is generafly still available as at 
Common Law, including matters of Defense or Set-off.“* According to Clark,*° some states limited the use of 
Bills of Particulars to actions involving accounts, or demands arising upon Contract. Motions

Complaint have frequently been used to perform the function of the Bill of Particulars. But in some states 
the Bill of Particulars is more limited in its application than an Amendment of the Complaint. It has been held that a 
Bill of Particulars limits the Complaint so that nothing can be claimed beyond what is set forth in the 
Bill.” On the other hand, it has been held that the plaintiff should not be permitted to rely on his 
Bill of Particulars to supplement his Complaint, but Clark suggests that the Bill of Particulars 
should perform this function and that an Amendment should not be required, and states this is the position taken in 
those State Systems where the Bill of Particulars is made definitely “a part of the pleading which it supplements.” ~ 


In New York, as in many other states, the Bill of Particulars,” is regulated by Statute or Rule of Court.”

(I) Demur, or 
(II) Plead: 
(A) A Dilatory Plea, or 


Œ) A Peremptory Plea, or Plea in Ear 


IF it is assumed that Every Liability consists of Two Elements—a given combination of Facts or Events, plus a 
Rule of Substantive Law attaching legal consequences to those Facts or Events; and if it be remembered that in order 
to state a good cause of action one need only set out the combination of facts and events, the Court taking Judicial 
Notice of the Rule of Law without its statement, the question arises: In how many ways may the defendant resist the 
Alleged Liability asserted in the Declaration? 


Confronted with this Alleged Liability, with a Declaration of the Facts only, the Minor Premise, and omitting the 
statement of the Rule of Law relied upon, the Major Premise, the defendant was compelled to Demur or Plead. He 
was bound to pursue one or the other of these two courses, until Issue was Tendered, if he desired to sustain his 
Defense. If he neither Pleaded nor Deinurred, but Confessed the right of the ad- 
verse party, or appeared but said nothing, the Court immediately Entered Judgment in favor of his adversary; in the 
former case, as by Confession; in the latter, where he said nothing, by nil dicit,’ 


If, however, the defendant Demurred, disputing the Rule of Law relied upon by the Plaintiff, he raised an Issue of 
Law, Triable by the Court; if he desired to Plead, thus disputing the Combination of Facts relied upon by the 
plaintiff, he raised an Issue of Fact, Triable by the Jury. If he desired to dispute the Rule of Law relied on by the 
plaintiff, he could do so by resorting to the procedural device known as the Demurrer, which developed in Two 
Forms, the General and the Special Demurrer, with the result that the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Law, 
which Issue, once Tendered, must be accepted by what was known as a Joinder in Demurrer. If the defendant 
Demurred Generally an Issue of Law was presented as to whether the Declaration was Substantively Defective; 
whereas, if the defendant Demurred Specially, an Issue of Law was raised as to whether the Declaration was 
Formally Defective.

CLASSIFICATION OF DEFENSES 
379 
PLEAS: DILATORY OR PEREMPTORY 


190. If the Declaration is sufficient in both Substance and Form, so that a Demurrer will not lie, or if the 
defendant does not wish to Demur, he must Plead: 
(D A Dilatory Plea, or 
(ID A Peremptory Plea, or Plea in Bar: 
(A) By Way of Traverse: 
(1) By Pleading the General Issue, or 


(2) By Pleading the Specific or Common Traverse, or 


Page 397 of 735 


(3) By Pleading the Special 
Traverse 
(B) By Way of Confession 
Avoidance: 
(1) In Justification and Excuse, or 
(2) In Discharge 
Dilatory Pleas 

IF the defendant desired to dispute the combination of facts and events relied upon by the plaintiff, he 
could do so by resorting to a procedural device known as the Plea, which might assume either one or two forms 
—a Dilatory Plea, or a Peremptory Plea, better known as a Plea in Bar. A Dilatory Plea sought to prevent the Entry 
of a Final Judgment on the Merits, whereas a Plea in Bar sought to bring about a Final Judgment on the Merits, If 
the defendant desired to prevent a Final Judgment on the Merits, that is, if he wished to use a Dilatory Plea, he could 
resort to any one of three procedural devices, known as one, a Plea to the Jurisdiction, on the ground that the court 
had no jurisdiction over either parties or subject matter of the action; two, a Plea in Abatement, which shows some 
ground for Abating or Defeating the Particular Action, without destroying the Right of Action itself; or three, a Plea 
in Suspension of the Action, which offered some reason why the plaintiff was temporarily disabled from pursuing 
the action at the time. 
Peremptory Pleas By Way Of Traverse or Confession And Avoidance 

IF, for any reason, the defendant did not 
desire to use a Dilatory Defense, or if such Defense proved futile, his only other recourse was to enter a Peremptory 
Plea or Plea in Bar, which might take either a Negative or Affirmative Form. If the defendant desired to dispute the 
combination of the facts relied upon by the plaintiff, he could do so by resorting to a procedural device known as a 
Traverse or Denial, which took one of three forms, one, the General Issue, which generally operated as a blanket 
denial of all the Material Allegations in the plaintiff's Declaraand tion; two, the Common or Specific Traverse, 
which denied One or More Material Allegations in the plaintiff s Declaration; and three, the Special Traverse, a 
highly technical form, capable of being used only in limited circumstances, which consisted of an inducement, 
containing affirmative new matter, a denial, and a verification, and which did not terminate the pleadings. In the 
case of the General Issue and the Common or Specific Traverse, the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Fact, triable 
by a Jury. In these Forms of Traverse, the General Issue and the Common or Specific Traverse, a Tender of Issue 
was required, which consisted of a Statement in the Pleading that the defendant was ready to go to the country, or to 
submit the issue to a Trial by Jury. 


If, however, the combination of facts and events and the Rule of Substantive Law relied upon by the plaintiff was 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action; if the alleged liability could not be met by a Dilatory Plea or by some Form 
of Negative Plea in Bar, the defendant might dispute the asserted liability by stating that the plaintiff had not told the 
full story, that is, that the defendant was willing to admit the combination of facts set out by the plaintiff, or that the 
plaintiff had stated a prima fade case, but that there was an additional combination of facts and events, 

380 

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Cli. 19 

plus an additional Rule of Substantive Law which equalled non-liability, or which changed the legal effect of the 
Allegations admitted. The defendant could accomplish this end by use of the procedural device known as a Plea in 
Confession and Avoidance, which took either one of two forms, one, a Plea by Way of Confession and Avoidance in 
Justification and Excuse; or two, a Plea by Way of Confession and Avoidance in Discharge, the difference being 
that the former assumes that no liability ever existed, and the latter assumes that liability once existed but has ceased 
to exist because of the happening of some subsequent fact or event. Thus, to illustrate, in Trespass for Assault and 
Battery, the Plea of Self-Defense assumes that the defendant was never liable in point of Substantive Law, whereas 
in Debt for Five Hundred Dollars, the Plea of Payment assumes that a debt which once was existent is now no 
longer existent because of the happening of some subsequent fact or event, to wit, Payment. Pleas in Confession and 
Avoidance were terminated with a statement that the defendant stood ready to verify his facts. 


It will be observed that if the Pleadings terminated in a Demurrer, an Issue of Law triable by the Court, arose; 
if the Pleadings terminated with some Form of Dilatory Plea, the settlement of the case on its merits suffered a 
temporary or permanent delay; if the Pleadings terminated in a Traverse, in the Form of the General Issue or the 
Common or Specific Traverse, an Issue of Fact triable by the Jury arose. But if the defendant pleads in Confession 


Page 398 of 735 


and Avoidance, tlle pleadings remain open, and no issue emerges, and the altercatlon continues until an issue is 
produced either by a demurrer or by a traverse. 


OThER STAGES OF PLEADING 

BEYOND THE DECLARATION AND PLEA 
that the defendant has met this by a Plea in Confession and Avoidance, the next Stage of Pleading is the 
Replication, after which follows a Rejoinder, a Surrejoinder, a Rebutter and a Surrebutter. Such a result, 
however, assumes that the preceding pleading was in each case in Concession and Avoidance. This process 
continues until one side or the other Traverses or Demurs, thus producing either an issue of Pact or of Law. 


Replication 

IF we assume that the defendant neither Demurs nor Pleads by way of Traverse, but seeks to evade liability by 
Pleading in Confession and Avoidance, the plaintiff, at the Third Stage of the Pleadings, may file a Replication to 
the defendant’s Plea, either Traversing it—that is, totally denying it—as, if in an action of debt upon bond the 
defendant pleads Payment—that he paid the money when due—the plaintiff in his Replication may totally Traverse 
this Plea, by denying that the defendant paid it, or the Replication may Confess and Avoid the Plea, by alleging 
some new Matter or Justification consistent with the Plaintiff's Declaration. Thus, in an action for trespassing upon 
land whereof the plaintiff is seised, if the defendant shows a title to the land by descent, and that therefore he had a 
right to enter, and gives color to the plaintiff, the plaintiff may either Traverse and totally Deny the Fact of the 
Descent, or he may Confess and Avoid it, by Replying that true it is that such descent happened, but that since the 
descent the defendant himself demised the lands to the plaintiff for term of life. 


Eejoinder 


TO the Replication the defendant may file a Pleading known as a Rejoinder, to which the plaintiff may, in his 
turn, Demur, or Plead, either by way of a Traverse, or in Confession and Avoidance, in a Surrejoinder. 


Eurrejoinder 

THE plaintiff, now j-leading for the third time, may answer the defendant’s Rejoinder

b~ filing what was known as a Surrejoinder, to which the defendant might interpose a Rebutter. 


Rebutter 


UPON this Pleading the defendant may in turn Demur or Plead by Way of Denial or by Way of Confession 
and Avoidance. 


Surrebntter 
AND the plaintiff might answer with a Pleading by Way of Surrebutter. 


It will be observed that these various 

Pleadings—Plea, Replication, Rejoinder, Surrejoinder, Rebutter and Surrebutter,—in legal theory, proceeded ad 
infinitum, until at some Stage of the Procedure the Pleadings terminated in either a Demurrer, thus raising an 
Issue of Law, triable by a Court; in some form of Dilatory Plea, in which instance the settlement of the case on its 
merits suffered a temporary or permanent delay; or in a Traverse, thus raising an Issue of Fact, triable by the 
Jury; but if the defendant in his Plea neither Demurs nor Traverses, but Pleads in Confession and Avoidance, 
the Pleadings remain open and do not terminate in either an Issue of Law or of Fact. Therefore, the plaintiff, 
at the Next Succeeding Stage of Pleading, the Replication Stage, may either Demur, or Plead by way of 
Traverse or in Confession and Avoidance, and so on, ad infinitum, until the plaintiff or defendant either 
Demurs, raising an Issue of Law, or Traverses, raising an Issue of Fact, thus reducing the controversy to a 


Page 399 of 735 


single clear-cut well-defined Issue of Law, or of Fact, which is the Primary Function of Pleading. 


If a party finds the Declaration or other pleadIng opposed to him to be Sufficient in Substance and Defective 
in Form, Sufficient in Form and Defective In Substance, or Insufficient in both respects, he has ample 
ground for Demurrer; but whether he should Demur or Plead is a matter of expediency, or of procedural 
tactics, which may influence 
favorably or unfavorably the outcome of the litigation. It may be useful therefore to examine the considerations 
by which, in view of what has been said about demurrers, the pleader should be governed in making his election to 
demur or plead. 


ELECTION TO DEMUR OR PL}L&D— FACTORS ‘tO BE CONSIDERED 


192. In many cases, a Party must Demur in order to take advantage of defects, while in others he may, 
even after Judgment, vaise objections which he might also have taken by Demurrer. In many cases it may not 
be advisable to Demur, even where a Demurrer would lie. 


IF the Declaration or other Pleading which may be involved is sufficient in both Form and Substance, the 
pleader has no alternative but to plead. If the Pleading is insufficient in either Form or Substance, there is good 
ground for either a Special or a General Demurrer; but whether the defect should be seized upon or taken 
advantage of depends upon several factors, Jf the Pleading be deemed insufficient in Form the pleader must 
inquire of himself whether it would be worth while to take the objection, in view of the indulgence which the law 
allows by way of Amendment; the pleader must also bear in mind that if the defect is not taken advantage of at 
that Stage of the Pleading, it may be Aided by a Subsequent Pleading, or after such Subsequent Pleading, by 
Verdict of the Jury, or by the Statutes of Jeofails and Amendments, If the pleader elects to Demur, he must 
take care to Demur Specially, lest, upon General Demurrer, he should be held excluded from the objection.t 
If, on the other hand, the Pleading in question is Defective in Substance, it must be determined whether the 
insufficiency is in the case itself or in the manner of statement, such, for ex

Ch. 19 

ample, as the Omission of an Allegation required by the Substantive Law as essential to the Cause of Action or 
Defense. In the latter case the Defect could easily be cured by an Amendment, hence it may therefore not be 
worthwhile to Demur. 


And whether the Defect was of such character as an Amendment would remove or not, a further question may 
arise as to whether it might not be desirable to ignore the objection at the moment and plead. By such tactics a party 
often gained the advantage of contesting the case with his adversary, in the first instance, by a Trial on the Merits of 
an Issue of Fact by a Jury; and in the second instance, if he lost on the Trial, by urging the Objection in Law, after 
Verdict and before Judgment, by Motion in Arrest of Judgment, or after Judgment, by Writ of Error. This maneuver, 
however, may not always prove successful; for though none but Formal Objections are cured by the Statutes of 
Jeofails and Amendments,’ there are some Defects of Substance as well as Form which may be Aided by 
Pleading Over as well as by the Verdict; and therefore, unless the fault be clearly of a kind not to be so Aided, 
a Demurrer is the only Mode of Objection that can be relied upon. The additional delay and expense of a Trial 
is also sometimes a material reason for proceeding in the regular way by Demurrer, and not waiting to Move in 
Arrest of Judgment, or to bring a Writ of Error. Another reason for demurring is that Costs are not generally 
allowed when Judgment is Arrested, nor where it is Reversed upon Writ of Error, but each party pays his own Costs, 
while on Demurrer the party succeeding obtains his Costs. 


It has been contended that Argument on 
Demurrer is usually futile. Time and effort are spent by Lawyers and Courts in criticizing Pleadings on points far 


Page 400 of 735 


removed from the

merits involved. The Demurring Attorney is engaged in educating his opponent on the Law. The tendency, 
therefore, is to avoid pointing out important Errors, or pressing them any more than is necessary to raise them on 
the Record in the Appellate Court. Demurring is seldom more than a waste of time and a means of delay, except 
(1) where there is some essential element of a Cause of Action or Defense which is not set up, and which cannot 
be supplied with any chance of proving it; (2) when the Pleading, although Good in Substance, is not as definite and 
certain as it ought to be, and by a Special Demurrer the Pleader may be required to state his case more in detail, 
thereby giving better notice, narrowing the issues, and increasing the risk of Variance in the Proof. In some 
jurisdictions Special Demurrers for Defects in Form have been abolished, but the line between Form and 
Substance is difficult to draw. To abolish Demurrers entirely, while allowing the same Objections in Point of 
Law to be raised under another name, is as ludicrous a piece of self-deception as the old Fictions in Ejectment. 
Some other solution of the abuses must be found.” 


FORCED ISSUES UNDER TUE CODES 


193. An early joinder of issue is forced under Codes which do not permit pleading beyond the answer or reply 
stage. 


UNDER Code Systems an early issue is forced by the Limited Series of Pleadings, the altercation being cut 
short at an arbitrary stage—the Answer in some Codes, the Reply In others, If a material issue has not been 
already evolved, an Issue of Fact is raised by Operation of Law, and with respect to any material New Matter 
alleged in the last pleading, the adversary may prove at Trial, in response thereto, any Facts by way

Definition 


THE word “Demurrer” is taken from the Latin word demorari and the French word demeurer, which, 
etymologically, primarily signifies a delay or pause, and is, at Common Law, the Formal and General Mode of 
disputing the sufficiency in Point of Law of the Pleading of an Adversary, either as to Form or Substance.” More 
specifically, a Demur-

rer is a Procedural Device, which neither asserts nor denies any Matter of Fact, but which, by failing to Deny the 
Facts in the Pleading to which it is interposed, leaves those Facts standing admitted, under the operation of the Rule that 
whatever is not Denied at the Next Succeeding Stage of Pleading, stands admitted, with the result that the only 
remaining question is One of Law as to whether, under the Substantive or Procedural Law, the Pleading 
Demurred to is sufficient, that is, in Form and in Substance. In other words, the Demurrer was one of the Proce- 
dural Devices which aided the Common Law in its Issue-Making Process. 


While, in a certain sense, a Demurrer is not a Pleading, in another sense, it is a pleading; that is, in the sense that 
if it is interposed to a Declaration, it will prevent the Entry of a Judgment by Default,’ in substantially the same way 
as would any Defense on the Merits. Thus, for instance, if A declares in Ejectment, alleging Title, Ouster and 
Damages, and B fails to Answer, a Judgment by Default will he Entered. Such, however, would not be the case if B 
interposed a Demurrer. In the sense that such use of a Demurrer will, like a Plea to the Merits, prevent the Entry of 
a Judgment by default, it may be regarded as a Pleading. 


The Office of a Demurrer 

THE Office of a Demurrer is to raise an Issue of Law as to whether the Pleading of the Adverse Party, to which 
the Demurrer is interposed, is sufficient on its Face to sustain the Cause of Action alleged, or to constitute a 
Defense, as the case may be. If a Demurrer is interposed to a Declaration, it

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS

raises an Issue of Law as to whether, on the Face of the Declaration, assuming the Facts alleged to be true, the 
plaintiff has stated Facts which, as a Matter of Substantive Law, and the Rules of Pleading, entitle him to the redress 
which he seeks. If he fails to in-dude an Allegation required by the Substantive Law, this constitutes a Substantive 
Defect, which, if Apparent upon the Face of the Declaration, may be reached, at the Pleading Stage by Demurrer; 
after Verdict and before Judgment, by Motion in Arrest of Judgment; and after Judgment, by Writ of Error, and 
possibly by Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict. At the Trial Stage, the same Defect might 
possibly be reached by Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, 


If, however, the plaintiff includes in his 
Declaration all the Allegations required by the Substantive Law to state a good Cause of Action, but states these 
Allegations in violation of some Rule of Pleading, he is said to be guilty of a Defect in Form, which may be 
reached at the Next Succeeding Stage of Pleading by a Special Demurrer. Thus, to illustrate, if the plaintiff in 
Ejectment, by way of stating Title, alleged that he had a “grant deed” of Blackacre, his Declaration would be 
bad on Special Demurrer, as having stated an Evidentiary Fact, which violates the Rule of Pleading that the 
plaintiff should have stated the Ultimate Fact of Title, to wit, that he was “seized” of Blackacre. If he had 
omitted any statement whatsoever as to Title, he would have been guilty of a Substantive Defect, which is 


Page 403 of 735 


generally available on General Demurrer. Generally speaking, therefore, a Special Demurrer was used to 
reach Defects in Form; while a General Demurrer was used to reach Defects in Substance; but since a Special 
Demurrer includes a General Demurrer, a Special Demurrer may also reach Defects in Substance, for 
reasons which will be explained in con- 

nection with the effect of the Statute of Demutters enacted in 1585.~ 


The Import of a Demurrer in Pleading 

A Demurrer, as we have seen, imports in Pleading that the Party will await the Judgment of the Court as to 
whether he is bound to answer the Pleading of his Adversary. In short, it advances the legal proposition that the 
Pleading Demurred to is Insuff icient in Law to maintain the case stated by the adverse party.” A Demurrer 
may be entered by either Party and to any Pleading until an Issue is joined;° and it may be for insufficiency 


either in Substance, as that the case shown by the opposite party is wanting in an essential 
element, as, for example, where a Declaration in Special Assumpsit for Breach of a Contract fails to allege Consid- 
eration or a Promise; or in Form, as that the Matter Alleged is substantially sufficient, but is stated in such an 
artificial manner as to violate a Rule of Pleading. For it is a cardinal principle of Law that every Pleading must

ments be wanting, it is cause for Demurrer;’ General if the Defect is Substantive, Special if it is Formal. 


By a Demurrer the party Demurring Tenders an Issue. It is not an Issue in Fact, but an Issue in Law, the 
question raised being whether the Pleading Demurred to is sufficient, as a Matter of Law, assuming the Facts to be 
true because not Denied, to require the party Demurring to answer it. As questions of Law are for the determination 
of the Court, the Demurrer refers the Issue to the Judgment of the Court.” 


THE SPEAKING DEMURRER 


195. A “Speaking Demurrer” is one which Alleges some New Matter, not Declared by the Pleading against which 
the Demurrer is aimed and not Judicially Known or Presumed to be true. 


WHEN a party Demurs to an Adversary’s Pleading, his object is to raise an Issue in Point of Law as to whether 
the Facts alleged are sufficient to sustain his opponent’s Cause of Action or Defense, as the ease may be. If the 
Demurrer is successful it eliminates any necessity to answer on the part of the Demurrant. It follows, therefore, that 
the Demurrant must accept the Facts Alleged in the Pleading Demurred to exactly as stated, and

A Demurrer is but a legal exception to the Sufficiency 
of a Pleading. Mason v. Cater, 192 Iowa 143, 182

109 N.E. 266 (1915). 


8- A Pleading which, with all reasonable inferences in favor of the Pleader, shows Facts entitling him to Relief, is not subject to Demurrer, the 
Office of which is to raise an Issue of Law as to the Substantial Rights of the Parties. Sogn v. Koetzle, 38 S.D. 99, 100 N.W. 520 (1916). 


that the Demurrer should be free from any Allegations of Fact additional to those Alleged in the Pleading to which 
it is interposed. And it should neither Deny the Facts stated, nor expand, reduce, modify or vary in any respect the 
Facts stated in the Pleading challenged.” A Demurrer which Denies any Fact in the Pleading to which it is ad- 
dressed, or which, in order to sustain itself, requires the suggestion of Additional Facts not Appearing on the Face of 
the Pleading objected to,” or seeks in any way to change or qualify the Statement of Facts presented in the Adverse 
Pleading, is called a Speaking Demurrer.'’ Such a Demurrer is customarfly overruled because, as a Speaking De- 
murrer, it violates a Rule of Pleading and is out of order.”” In some cases, however, if such a Demurrer raises a 
meritorious Point of Law, it may be considered, the fact impertinently suggested being ignored.”

Facts.” Jennings v. Peoria Co., 196 Ill.App. 195, 198

THE DEMURRER AND OTHER PLEAD 
INGS DISTINGUISHED 


196. A Demurrer can never be founded upon 
Matter Collateral to the Pleading which it Opposes, but must always arise on the Face of the Statement of the 
Facts itself. 


THE distinction between a Demurrer and 

Other Pleading is that a Demurrer raises an Objection as to the Intrinsic Insufficiency of the Pleading to which it is 
interposed,” 

whereas a Plea, Replication, Rejoinder, or Other Pleading containing a Statement of Facts, undertakes to defeat 
the adversary by the injection into the Case of Matter Collateral to that which has been alleged by the adversary. 
Because of this distinction, the Common-Law Rule and the Rule under the Statute of Anne (1705)15 was that a 
Party could not Plead and Demur at the Same Time to the Same Matter. The defendant was not, at Common Law, 
permitted to Plead and Demur because of the incongruity between the Plea and the Demurrer. This Rule was not 


Page 405 of 735 


altered by the Statute of Anne (1705), as it merely permitted a defendant to Plead Several Defenses, and a 
Demurrer, as we have seen, was strictly speaking not a Plea, but rather an Excuse for Not Pleading.’° 


TUE SCOPE OF A DEMURRER 


197. the Demurrer, as a Procedural Weapon, may be used to attack the Adversary’s Pleading as a Whole, 
or in Part. In so doing 


14. Gould, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading, Ft 111, 01 Pleading, 571 (6th ed. by Will, Albany, 1900). 


15.4 Anne, c. 16, § 4, 11 Statutes at Large 150, which provided: “And be it further enacted by the Autbority aforesaid, That from and after the 
said first day of Trinity Term it shall and may be Lawful for any defendant or Tenant in any Action or Suit, or for any plaintiff in Replevin, in 
any Court of Record, with the Lea-re of the Same Court, to Plead as many Several Matters thereto, as he shall think necessary for his 
Defense.” 


16. See Gould, A ‘Treatise on the Principles of Pleading Pt. III, Of Pleading, 340 (6th Cd. by Will, Albany 1909). 
the Demurrant must be careful not to make his Demurrer too large, and not to violate the Rule against 
Pleading and Demurring at the Same Time to the Same Matter. 


ThE Demurrer may be used as an offensive instrument for an attack upon an Adversary’s Pleading. And 
such attack may be directed at the whole of the Plaintiff s Cause 
of Action or the Defendant’s Defense, as the case may be, or to a Part Only. In making such a use of the 
Demurrer, a defendant, in Demurring to a Declaration in its Entirety, must be certain that his Demurrer is not too 
large.’’ Thus, for example, in Cochran v. Scott,” the plaintiff Declared as the indorsee of a Promissory Note, payable 
to the Lawrence Power Company, Alleging an indorsement by the company, without setting forth the names of the 
members of the firm; he also Declared on several Money Counts; the defendant Demurred to the Whole Declara- 
tion, Assigning Special Cause for only One Count, and None for the others; and the Court gave Judgment for the 
plaintiff. Where a Declaration contains Several Counts or Statements of Causes of Action, some good in both Form 
and Substance, and some Defective, the defendant should Demur only to the Defective Counts, as Judgment will be 
given against him on an exception to the whole declaration, separate and divisible parts of it being good? A 
Demurrer may sometimes be taken to part of a single Count or Plea, where the matters alleged are distinct and 
divisible in their nature.”°

Sec. 198 
THE DEMURRER 
389 

But a plaintiff s Demurrer to Several Defenses, some good in Form and Substance and some bad in either Form 
or Substance, should not be too large, as a defendant needs but one Defense to win. Thus, in Mayor,~ etc. oJ 
Newark v. Dickerson, et al.,’~ where the plaintiff Declared in Debt against a Surety on a Bond, to which the 
defendant interposed ten Pleas, and the plaintiff filed a single Demurrer to three of the Pleas, one of which was good 
in Substance, whereas the others were bad, the Court, through Dixon, J., said: 
“If any of the Pleas Demurred to presents a good Defence, the defendant is entitled to Judgment.” 22 


Whether the Demurrer is used as an offensive or Defensive Weapon, the Pleader should be careful not to Plead 
and Demur at the Same Time to the Same Matter, as such a course of procedure would violate a fundamental Theory 
of Common-Law Pleading that you cannot create an Issue of Law and an Issue of Fact simultaneously on the Same 
Matter,

GENERAL AND SPECIAL DEMURRERS AND DEFECTS AVAILABLE 


THEREUNDER 
198. There are two Kinds of Demurrer; they are: 
(I) General, and 
(2) Special. 


A General Demurrer is one which Excepts to the sufficiency of the Opposing Pleading in General Terms, 
without Specifically disclosing the Nature of the Objection. In general, a General Demurrer reaches Defects 
in Substance. 

A Special Demurrer takes Exception to the sufficiency of the Adverse Pleading by showing Specifically the 
Particular Defects in Form which are the basis of such Exception. It is necessary where the Objection turns 
on Matter of Form only. In general, a Special Demurrer reaches Defects in Form which are specified in the 


Demurrer, and also reaches Defects in Substance.

The General and Special Demurrer Under the Regime of Oral Pleading 

PRIOR to the Statute of Elizabeth (1585) -2s cited or described in the books as the Statute of Demurrers, and an 
important Statute of Jeofails,”” there were Two Kinds of Demurrer, the General Demurrer and the Special. 
According to the case, Anonymous,” decided in 1704, and in which the opinion rendered was by Chief Justice Holt 
of the Court of King’s Bench, upon a General Demurrer, a Party might take advantage of all Types of Defects, 
Formal or Substantive,” 


25. 27 Bus. c. 5, 6 Statutes at Large 360. 


26. The word “Jeofails” means, I have failed; I am in error- Certain Statutes in English Law are referred to as Statutes of Amendment and 
Jeofails, because where a Pleader perceives any slip in the Form of his Proceedings, and acknowledges the error (jeofails) he is at liberty by 
those Statutes to Amend it. 


For a complete list of the Statutes, the earliest of which was enacted in 1340, 14 Edw. IIL e. 6, 1 Statutes at Large 474, see article by Reppy, The 
Hilary Rules and Their Effect on Negative and Affirmative Pleas Under Modem Codes and Practice Acts, C N.Y.tLL,Rev. 95, 100, n. 19 
(1929).

that of Duplicity only excepted, and without the Assignment of Any Cause for Demurrer. Upon a Special 
Demurrer, so called because it Assigned a Specific Cause of Demurrer, Ordinary Formal Defects were available 
as on a General Demurrer. As these Ordinary Formal Defects were reached by a General Demurrer, without the 
necessity of specif ically pointing them out as was required in a Special Demurrer, the Latter Form of Demurrer 
was never necessary, except in a case involving Duplicity.” In such case it was not sufficient to say that the Pleading 
was Double, or contained Two Matters, but the Party Demurring was required to show of what the Duplicity 
consisted.’ Perhaps the reason for this Exception may be discovered in the peculiarity of this Specific Defect. 
Technically, Duplicity constituted neither a Formal nor a Substantive Defect, that is, it was not a Substantive Defect, 
because not too few, but rather too many Facts had been alleged; and it was not a Defect in Form, for what was al- 
leged had been stated without violation of a Rule of Pleading, hence the Only Defect present—the statement of 
Superfluous Facts— was held to be available only on Special Demurrer.

Duplicity in the Declaration was a common Ground for Special Demurrer at Common Law. Handy v. Chatfield, 23 Wend. (N.Y.) 35 (1840). 
But for the attitude of the courts of today on Duplicity, see Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Bates Expanded Steel Truss Co., 11 P.24 415

“No Pleading shall be deemed insufficient for any Defect which could heretofore o,,ly be objected to by Special Demurrer,” Duplicity, 
along with other Formal Defects, ceased to be available on Demurrer. The remedy Is now by Motion.

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 

Ch. 20 

It provided that upon Demurrer Joined and Entered in any Action or Suit in any Court, the Judges should give 
Judgment “according as the Very Right 0/the Cause and Matter in Law shall appear unto them” without regardng 
any Defect in Form whatsoever, “except those only which the Party Demurring shalt Specially and Particularly set 
down and express together with his Demurrer!’ 


What, in plain English, does this mean? The phrase, “according as the Very Right of the Cause and Matter in 
Law shall appear unto them” translated into plain English, means that the Judges thereafter shall decide the Cases 
on the Merits, and in complete disregard of any imperfection, defect or watt of Form in any Pleading, except those 
only which the Demurring Party specifically points out and sets down “together with his Demurrer.” What 
Demurrer? Answer, the General Demurrer. A Special Demurrer therefore, under the Statute, is merely a General 
Demurrer, to which is added a specification or pointing out of some Defect in Form in an Adversary’s Pleading, 
as indicated by the italicized part of the Form of a Special Demurrer set out above. In other words, the Statute 
provides that Defects in Form are aided or waived unless taken advantage of by Special Demurrer at the next 
Succeeding Stage in Pleading. 


Defects in Form, after the Statute, might, however, still prove fatal, but only if specifically objected to by openly 
pointing out the defect at the next Stage of Pleading.” Thus, 


31. “This Statute, by making kuown the Causes of Demurrer, was so far restorntive of the common 
Law; and as a General Demurrer before did confess all Matters Formaliy Pleaded, so by this Statute, whenever the right 


sufficiently appeared to the Court, it confessed all Matters, though Pleaded informally.” 8 Tidd, The Practice of the Court of King’s Bench, 
c. XXX, 649 (1st. Sin. ed., Philndelphia 1807). 


See, also, English: ICing v. Botham, Freem. 38, 89 Eng.Bep. 31 (1672); Illinois: Cook v. Scott, 1 Gil-man (Th.) 333 (1844); Gordon v. Bankard, 
37 Lii. 147 (1863); Cover v. Armstrong, 66 Ill. 267 (1872); Mas 


in the famous case of Heard v. Baskervile,~ decided in 1614, or only twenty-nine years after the Enactment of the 
Statute, the Court concluded, upon finding a Defect in a Pleading to be a Matter of Form, that the Defect could not 
be taken advantage of upon General Demurrer, as “a General Demurrer doth confess all matters pleaded”, though 
not pleaded in proper form. A General Demurrer, therefore, automatically waives all Defects in Form, except in 
the case of a General Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement,” 


What the Statute of Anne Provided 

THE Kinds and Forms of Deinurrers after 1705 remained substantially the same, except for a slight alteration in 
the Scope of the Special Demurrer. The Statute of Anne (1705), was merely a Reenactment of the Statute of 
Elizabeth (1585), almost word for word, with a proviso that “sufficient Matter appear in the said Pleadings, upon 
which the Court may give Judgment according to the Very RAght of the Cause, ”” plus an enumeration of 


Certain Defects, which upon the construction of the Prior Statute, had been held to be Substantial, but which 
were now to be held Formal, and hence Aided upon General Demurrer, the conservative views of the Judges to the 
contrary notwithstanding. As Could ~ has so accurately stated, the Statute

plaintiff failed to allege the writing, this was held to be a Defect available on Demurrer.” 
Exception to the General Rule as to Defects Available upon a General Demurrer 

WHILE the General Rule is that upon a General Demurrer only Defects in Substance are available, there is an 
exception to the rule where the plaintiff files a General Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement Defective in Form.” In 
Humphrey v. Whitten,~ where the plaintiff brought Ti-over against the defendant in the name of James Humplvreys, 
the defendant Pleaded that he was and “always had been known by the name of James Humphrey, and not James 
Humphreys, as by the plaintiff's Writ supposed, to which Plea the plaintiff Demurred Generally. Since the 
defendant’s Plea contained New Matter, in order to be in Proper Form, it should have concluded with a Verification, 
which it did not contain. There was therefore a question as to whether a Defect in Form in a Plea in Abatement could 
be reached by a General Demurrer after the Statute of Elizabeth and the Statute of Anne. In reviewing the Common 
Law, the Court concluded that the General Demurrer reached the Defect in Form—the failure to have a 
Verification—in the Plea in Abatement. Why? Because, at Common Law, prior to the Statute, a General 
Demurrer reached both Defects in Form and Defects in Substance in a Pleading to which it was interposed, and 
since the Statute of Elizabeth and the Statute of Anne only applied fo Pleas in Bar, the Original Common Law as 
to the Scope of a General Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement was not changed, and therefore, as a General 


Demurrer reached a Defect in Form in a Plea in Abatement before 1585, it still reached it after 1585, the

Common-Law Rule not having been disturbed, Thus, the Exception to the General Rule that in order to reach a 

Defect in Form in a Pleading after the Statute of Demurrers, you must Demur Specially.“ 

The General Rule as to Defects Available Upon a Special Demt~rrer After the Statute of Elizabet!v (1585) 
and the Statute of Anne (1705) 

THE General Rule was that upon a Special Demurrer any Defect in Form, as created by a Violation of a 
Rule of Pleading as to the Manner and Form in which a Substantive Allegation should be Averred, was available, if 
the Cause of Demurrer was Specifically Assigned. Thus, for example, Uncertainty of Allegation, Improper Ending 
of a Plea, Joinder of Several Causes of Action in a single Count, or any other Violation of a Rule of Pleading, 
constitutes a Defect in Form. 

In addition, as observed above, as a Special Demurrer is, under the Statute of Elizabeth (1585), merely a 
General Demurrer to which has been added a specification of some Defect in Form in the Adversary’s Pleading, 
Defects in Substance were also reached by a Special Demurrer. 

The Defect of Duplicity 
PRIOR to the Statute of Elizabeth (1585), the Defect of Duplicity (which was neither a Formal nor a Substantive 


Defect) was, as a 
4. Shaw v. Duteher, 19 Wend. (N.Y.) 216, 222, 228 (1838), in which Co~ven, 3., declared: “Testing the Plea below by these Rules, it is fatally 
defective. It begins and concludes by praying Judgment of the Said Bill, I Incline to think that this was a Defect of Substance; but if of Form 


only, being in Abatement, the Defect need not be assigned specially, such Is the construction of the English Statutes of Special Deniurrers, 
27 Eliz., e. V, & 4 Anne, c, 16, and ours is but an epitome of those Acts. 2 ItS. 276, 2d ccl. The English authorities to this point will be found

of Anne (1705) was enacted “partly in explanation and partly in extension of the healing operation of the 
Former Act—and also expressly specifying a variety of Particular Defects, which, though before deemed Sub- 
stantial, are, by this latter Act, virtually converted into Matters of Form md thus Aided on General Demurrer. The 
Statute of Elizabeth, then, requires Demurrers to be Special, for Formal Defects, in general; and that of Anne, after 
Reenacting the same general provision, extends, or applies it to certain Particular Defects, expressly named in the 
Act.” — 
The General Rules as to Defects Available 

Upon a General Demurrer After the 

Statute of Elizabeth (1585) and the 

Statute of Anne (1705) 


AFTER the Amendment of the Statute of 
Elizabeth (1585) by the Statute of Anne 
(1705), the General Rule was that upon a 
General Demurrer any Substantive Defect 

was available. 

Other Defects available upon General Dernurrer include a Misjoinder of Causes of Action in the same 
Declaration; ~ Misjoinder or Nonjoinder of Parties plaintiff or defendant, if the Defect is Apparent on the Face 
of the Pleading; 38a Variance; -sor 


barred its extension to Actions on Penal Statutes, which are Civil Suits, But this proviso, in the year 1731, was repealed by the Statute of 4 Ceo. 
IT, c. 
26, § 4. 
36. “The Defects specifically cnuo,crotej, and cured, 
by this latter Statute, are irn,nateriai traverses—the omissioii of profert of Deeds, Sm—or of the words vi ci armis, and contra pacern—.or of a 
verification per recordicn—or Of a prout patet per records,,,.. 


All these Defects nrc therefore Aided by this Statute, on Demurrer, unless specially assigned for Cause of Demurrer.” Could, A Treatise on the

Allegations in the Disjunctive.** Ordinarily the Statute of Limitations is not available on Demurrer, as the General 

Rule is that it is no part of the plaintiff's case to show that his Action is not Barred by the Statute of Limitations, 

Such a showing may be essential where the Period of Limitation is treated as a part ol~ the right created by a Statute. 

If, in the absence of such a Statute, a Declaration or Complaint discloses on its Face that the Action is Barred by the 

Statute of Limitations, there is a conflict of opinion, the genera! tendency of which is against the availability of the 

Defect on Demurrer.” The situation with respect to whether the Statute of Frauds is available on Demurrer raises 

substantially the same problem as tile Statute of Limitations. At Common Law the Rule was that where an Action 

was founded upon a Contract which at Common Law was valid without a writing, but which the Statute required to 

be in writing, it was not necessary for the Declaration to Count upon or take notice of the writing.42 If, however, a 

Statute created a right which did not exist at Common Law, and required a writing, and the

matter of Precedent in Pleading, only available upon a Special Demurrer. In fact, the Special Demurrer was seldom 
used for any other purpose, as an Ordinary Defect in Form was available on General Demurrer, without any 
Assignment of Cause. After the Statute, Duplicity, despite its peculiarity as a fault, was treated as a Formal Defect, 
and hence available upon a Snecial Demurrer.*’ But in Oklahoma Gas c~ Electric Co. v. Bates Expanded Steel 
Truss Co.” where the defendant Demurred Specially to the First and Second Counts of an Amended Declaration in 
Case on the Ground of Duplicity, the Court, regarding the Rules of Pleading as but juridical instrumentalities for the 
furtherance of Justice, and taking note of a statutory reguirement that pleadings should be framed to promote 
“conciseness, brevity and plainness”, overruled the Demurrer, where at Common Law the Demurrer would have 
been sustained. And in England, under the influence of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852, which provided 
that “no Pleading shall be deemed insufficient for any Defect which could heretofore only be objected to by Special 
Demurrer,” - Duplicity, along with other Formal Defects, ceased to be available on Demurrer. The remedy is now

Five Exceptions to the General Rule that Every Violation of a Rule of Pleading is a Defect in Form 

THE General Rule is that any Violation of a Rule of Pleading constitutes a Defect in Form. To this General 
Rule, however, there were at least Five Exceptions, that is, there were some situations in which a mere Violation of a 
Rule of Pleading was held as a Matter of Precedent to constitute a Defect in Substance, and therefore could be taken 
advantage of on General Demurrer. This re-’ suited in case of (1) a Departure; (2) a Discontinuance; (3) a 
Mispleader; (4) a Misconception of the Correct Form of Action; and (5) a Misjoinder of Counts. The first three of 
them are Aided by a Verdict; the last two constitute grounds for a Motion in Arrest of Judgment or Writ of Error, but 
are not Aided by a Verdict.” 
Motions to Strike Out 

THE usual Method of Objection to parts of a Pleading is now by Motion to Strike Out what is superfluous, 
redundant, or immaterial, and thus clear up the Issues by use of the pruning hook.” By filing an Amended

flint a Pleading shall not fail for want of Form and that the Sufficiency of all Pleadings In this respect is for the discretionary determination of 
the Trial Court, the function of a Demur- 

rer is to test the Sufficiency of a Pleading in Matters of Substance only. Ceburn v. Village of Swnnton, 05 Vt. 320, 324, 325, 115 A, 133. The 
Modern Demurrer resembles the Former Special Demurrer merely in that the Act, FL. 1574, III, requires it distinctly to specify the reason 
why the Pleading Demurred to is insufficient. Coates v. Eastern States Farmers Exchange, 99 Vt. 110, ITt 130 A. 709. It follows that, in our 
practice, Special Demurrers as known in the Common Law have bec,i iinphiedly abolishcd, and therefore Duplicity in Pleading, being, as we 
have seen, a Defect In Form, is to be reached by an appropriate Motion under the Provisions of FL. 1578. A similar procedure obtains in other 
Jurisdictions where Special De~ murrers are no longer recognized.”

Pleading after a Demurrer is sustained, or by answering after a Demurrer is overruled, the Party waives any 
Exception to the Ruling before the Appellate Court.” Therefore, a Motion to Strike Out, rather than a Demurrer, 
may be preferable to save the benefit of 
the objection.

Conclusions of Fact or

based on the Face of the Pleading to which it is interposed. Thus, a Speak-

Two Fundamental Rules Covet-fling Admissions by Dernun’er 

THERE are Two Rules that Govern Admissions by Demurrer. The first Rule is that a Demurrer will admit any 
Fact that is Well. Pleaded «and will not admit any Fact that is JllPleaded; ~ the second Rule is that a Demurrer 
will not admit any Fact which the Court takes Judicial Notice to be impossible or untrue. And the Technical 
Objective of these two rules was to test the Legal Effect of the Allegations to which they were addressed and to aid 
in the Issue-Formulation Process of Separating Questions of Fact from Questions of Law, for ready reference to the 
Court or Jury, depending on whether the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Fact or an Issue of Law. 

Clit 20 
Sec. 199 
THE DEMURRER 


A Demurrer wiTh Admit any Fact thzzt is Well-Pleaded and Will not Admit any Fact that is Ri-Pleaded 


Page 415 of 735 


VO WwW 


IN connection with the first Rule, the question arises as to when is a Fact Well-Pleaded or Ill-Pleaded? A Fact is 
Well-Pieaded when it is required by the Substantive Law as essential to the Statement of a Cause of Action or 
Defense, and is then Pleaded without Violating any Rule of Pleading. A Fact is Ill-Pleaded when it is not required 
by the Substantive Law as essential to the Statement of a Cause of Action or Defense, or when, being so required, it 
is then Pleaded in Violation of one or more Rules of Pleading. 

Thus if A sued B in Ejectment and Alleged, by way of Title, that he was Seized of Black-acre, the Allegation of 
Title was Well-Pleaded, because it was required by the Substantive Law of Real Property as essential to the 
Statement of a Cause of Action in Ejectment, and because it was Alleged without Violating any Rule of Pleading. 
If, however, A had Alleged, by way of Title, that he had a Grant Deed of Blackacre, his Allegation of Title would 
have been IIl-Pleaded, as a Deed is Mere Evidence of Title, and amounts to the Statement of an Evidentiary Fact, a 
Defect available on Special Demurrer. 

Assuming that the Facts are Well-Pleaded, a Demurrer thereto admits, for the Purpose of Argument, that they 
are true,”° and the only question for the Court is one of Law as to whether there is any Rule of Substantive Law 


attaching Legal Effect to the Facts 
U. English: Barber v. Vincent, Freem.K.B. 531, 89 
Eng.Rcp. 398 (1580); Connecticut: Lamphear v. 


Buekingbam, 33 Conn. 237 (1866); Illinois: Coinpher v. People, 12 III. 290 (1850); Nhspcl v. Laparle, 
74111. 376 (1874); Vermont: Matthews v. Tower, 39 
Vt, 433 (ISGT). 
It not only thus admits the Facts, but it also admits the consequences of those Facts, provided such consequences may fairly be considered as 


their legitiTaste results. Hyde v. Mortar, 26 Vt. 271 (1544), And, see also, Dickerson v. Winslow, 07 Ala. 491, 11 So. 918 (1892). 
Stated.” The Rule is subject, however, to the qualification that the Matter must be sufficiently Pleaded, that is in 
the Manner and Form required by LaW.`' If the Facts were not Alleged in Proper Form, they were not admitted by 
a Demurrer under the Common-Law Rule which prevailed prior to the Statute of Elizabeth (1585) and the Statute of 
Anne (1705) P° This Rule was changed by these Statutes, the Law of Demurrers being altered in such a way that 
thereafter Facts not Alleged according to the Form required by Procedural Law, might be admitted by Demurrer in 
some instaiwes.~° This usually results where the Demurrer is General, instead of Special, as this usually amounts 
to a Confession of the Matter Informally Pleaded, thus qualifying the earlier Common-Law Rule that a Demurrer 
did not admit an EPleaded Fact.& 

A Demurrer does not admit Conclusions, either of Fact or of Law, which the Adverse Party may have seen fit to 
draw in his PleadingP Thus, in Milivilte Gas Light Company 
57. A Demurrer to the Declaration raises a question of Law whether the plaintiff, upon the Facts stated, is entitled to Recovery. Virginia: 

Itenderson v. Stringer, S Grat. (Vt) 130 (1849); Federal: Hobson “CC MeArthur, 3 McLean, 241, Fed.Cas.Nq.6,554 (1843). 


It Is not the Office of the Demurrer to Allege Pacts, but it is concerned with such Facts as are stated In the Pleading Demurred to. Jennings v, 
Peoria County, 196 Ill_App. 195 (1915).

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Ch. 20 

v. Sweeten, &c., et aZ.,C the plaintiff Alleged that the defendants, under a contract with the city of Miliville, for 
the construction of a sewage system, dug up certain streets in the city where the plaintiff had laid gas pipes, which it 
thcreupon became the defendants’ duty to support, protect and render safe during the construction of the sewage 
system, and that in disregard of this duty the pipes were so negligently supported that they became broken, and 
severed, to the injury of plaintiff. The only information derivable from the plaintiff s Declaration, with reference to 
the existence of the defendant’s Duty to plaintiff, was that plaintiff's pipes were “laid in the said streets by 
competent and legal authority.” On a Demurrer by the defendant, it was held that the Demurrer did not admit the 
plaintiff s Allegation as to its authority to occupy the highway with its pipes; in short, a Demurrer does not admit a 
Conclusion of Law. 

But this is not always so. When the plaintiff, in stating title to real estate alleges that he is seized of Blackacre, he 
is Alleging a Conclusion of Law, yet if the defendant Demurs, he will lose, as this particular Conclusion of Law is 
one which, as a Matter of Precedent in Law, is treated as a Statement of Ultimate Fact, and hence the 
Demurrer admits it. So, when we say that a Demurrer will not admit a Conclusion of Law, we refer to that type of 
Conclusion of Law, which, as a Matter of Precedent, is not treated as a Statement of Ultimate Fact, 

“Where the Facts are stated in a Pleading the Pleader may, and often should, state that Conclusion from such 
Facts upon which he bases his right, but where the Facts upon which the Pleader’s Conclusion is based are not stated 
his Conclusicyn from such Undis 


conclusions, whether stated in the Complaint or not, that a Demurrer Is directed, and to which It applies the proper test.” Branham y. 
Mayor, etc. of City of San Jose, 24 CaL 585, 602 (1864). 


63. 74 N.J.L. 24, 04 AU. 950 (1906). 
closed Facts goes for nothing, and not being in itself a Relevant Fact is not admitted by a Demurrer.” 64 

Although a Demurrer admits Facts Well-Pleaded, its operation in this respect is only for the purpose of 
determining their legal sufficiency.” It is strictly confined to this purpose, and cannot be made use of as an 
Instrument of Evidence on an Issue of Fact,°° or as Evidence of Facts in another Cause; and, as observed, the 
admission is for the purpose of the argument only.°!

ample of the operation of this principle is found in the case in which the plaintiff sues in Trespass to Real Estate, the 
defendant pleads that he has not been served with a Summons, and the plaintiff Demurs. The defendant says, “I win, 
because, by your Demurrer you admit a lack of Service.” But the plaintiff wins, because a Demurrer does not admit 
a Fact which the Court by Judicial Notice knows to be untrue. Whether the defendant was served can only be Seen 
from looking at the Return of the Sheriff, which states that the defendant has been Served. The Return of the Sheriff 
is a part of the Common-Law Record, the Court Judicially Notices its own Record, hence the Court Judicially knows 
that defendant has been Served, that the defendant’s allegation of lack of service is untrue, and what the Court 
Judicially knows to be untrue is not admitted by Deniurrer%? This does not apply to facts of which the Court 
cannot take Judicial Notice, though the Court may have private knowledge that they are untrue. Thus, in the case of 
Hodges v. Steward,’° in which the plaintiff brought Assumpsit upon an Inland Bill of Exchange, declaring upon a 
Special Custom in London for the bearer to bring the Action, and the defendant Demurred, it was held that since 
the Court only Judicially Noticed the general Law of Merchants, as part of the Law of England, whereas this 
custom was a local custom of England, the Demurrer admitted the local custom, even in the face of the fact that 
the Court might have known of its own knowledge that no such local custom existed. Accordingly, Judgment was 
given for the plaintiff, although the defendant might have had a good Defense if he had Traversed or Denied the 


local custom, instead of Demurring. 
months and ten dayc, were not vaiuable, as it was incapable of performing valuable service.

Will a Demurrer Admit the Pleader’s Conclusions as to the Construction of a Statute~ 

AN interesting aspect of Admission by Demurrer as affected by the Doctrine of Judicial Notice appears in 
determining whether a Pleader’s Conclusion as to the Construction of a Statute is Admitted by a Demurrer. The 
Issue was clearly presented in the Illinois Case of Compher v. People.” This was an Action on a Bond executed by 
the county collector, in which the county collector and his sureties were defendants. One of the Pleas, after referring 
to various Statutes enacted subsequent to the date of the Bond, alleged that thereby the Liability of the sureties was 
materially changed; and it was insisted that the plaintiffs, by Demurring to the Plea, admitted to the truth of the 
Construction of the Statutes as set forth by the defendants. The Court held that the Laws in question were Public 
Acts, and that the plaintiffs, by Demurring to a Plea construing them, did not admit such construction to be correct. 

In considering this problem there are three situations to bear in mind: (1) Where the Action is based upon a Local 
Statute, and the Pleading sets out the Statute in Substance or Verbatim, the construction of the Pleader is not 
admitted by Demurrer, as the Court takes Judicial Notice of Local Law; (2) Where a Pleading sets out the Terms of 
a Foreign Statute, and then places a construction upon it, such construction is not admitted by Demurrer; 72 and (3) 
where the Pleading states the Substance of a Foreign Statute, it is treated as any other Allegation of Fact, and hence 


is admitted by Demurrer. as the Court will not take Judicial Notice of a Foreign Statute.”

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 


EFFECT OF DEMURRER—IN OPENING THE RECORD” 


2Db. A Demurrer Opens up the Whole Record and the Court will render Judgment against the First Party 
Guilty of a Substantive Defect; as to Form, a Special Demurrer only reaches Defects in Form in the Pleading 
Demurred to, but since a Special Demurrer includes a General, it also Opens up the Entire Record as to 
Substantive Defects. These General Rules as to the Retrospective Effect of a Demurrer are sometimes subject 
to several exceptions. 
Exceptions: A Demurrer will not Open up 
the Record back to the Declaration so as to cause Judgment to be rendered against the First Party Guilty of a 
Substantive Defect: 
(1) Where the plaintiff Demurs to a Plea in Abatement 
(2) Where there has been a Discontinuance along one of several lines of Plead- 

ing 
(3) Where the defendant interposes more than one Plea, one of which is a Plea of the General Issue, and there 
is a Demurrer at a later Stage in the Pleadings 
(4) Where the plaintiff Demurs to a Plea 
which has been entered by the defendant after defendant’s Demurrer to the Declaration has been over- 
ruled 

Although, on Demurrer, the Court will generally consider the Whole Record, and give Judgment for the 
Party who, on the whole, appears Entitled to it, where, though the Right,

THE DEMURRER 


lice is that upon Demurrer, the Court goes back to the Declaration and makes a Search of the Record for Substantive 
Defects, taking each Stage of the Pleadings in order, and then gives Judgment against the Party Guilty of the First 
Substantive Error. Before a Party Demurs, therefore, he should be certain that his own fences are in good repair. 


Page 420 of 735 


— OP 


Thus, if the plaintiff declares in Replevin for a Specific Chattel, but fails to allege Title, and the defendant Pleads the 
Statute of Limitations, to which the plaintiff Demurs, Judgment will go for the defendant, the plaintiff having failed 
to state Title in his Declaration, thus making himself guilty of the First Sub. stantive Defect. And, on Demurrer to a 
Replication, if the Court regards the Replication bad, but perceives a Substantive Defect in the Plea, Judgment will 
be given, not for the defendant, but for the plaintiff, provided the Declaration is good as a Matter of Substantive 
Law; but if the Declaration is Defective in Point of Substance, then, upon the same principle, Judgment would be 
given in favor of the defendant,’’ The Demurrer, at whatever Stage of the Pleadings it is interposed; reaches back in 
its effect, through the Whole Record, and ultimately attaches to the First Substantive Defect in the Plead- 

not show a Cause of Action, Judgment shall be given against the plaintiff and the Complaint dismissed, (Code, See. 148). If the Demurrer be to 


the Reply, the plaintiff may show that the Answer is insufficient, and have Judgment in his favor. 
“There is no more reason now than formerly, that a plaintiff should have Judgment on Demurring to an Answer, when it appears upon the Face of 


the Record that he has No Cause of Action; or that the defendant should succeed on Demurrer to the Reply, when it Is apparent upon his 

Answer that he has No Defense.”

ing~’* on whichever side it may have occurred; and therefore, though the Parties join in the Demurrer upon any 
particular point, at any Stage of the Pleadings, Judgment must still be given upon the Whole Record, and regularly 
against the Party in whose Pleading such fault occurred. This Rule belongs to the General Principle that when 
Judgment is to be given, whether the Issue be in Law or Fact, and whether the Cause has proceeded to Issue or not, 
the Court is always bound to examine the Whole Record, and adjudge for the plaintiff or defendant, according to the 
Legal Right, as it may, on the whole, appear.m 

However, a Demurrer will not open tip the Record back to the Declaration when the plaintiff, at the Replication 
Stage of Pleading, Demurs Specially to the defendant’s Plea, which is Substantively Defective, and there is a Defect 
in Form in the Declaration. This results from the Statute of Elizabeth,~ which provided for Waiver of all Defects in 
Form unless objected to at the next Succeeding Stage in Pleading, or to put the Matter in another way, a Special 
Demurrer only reaches Defects in Form in the Pleading

must then hear another Motion to set the preceding one to rights also: by which mole half a dozen questions might be made on the Propriety of 


Proceedings, only one of wh:eh might he determined at any one Court. This would be the means of lengthening out an Issue to an 
unreasonable length of time, and to the very great delay of Justice. Whereas, by the Rule laid down above, that the Court will look for the first 
Fault, and give Judgment accordingly, all 


the snbsequent Defective Proceedings arc at once.. 
and by one single decision, set at naught, and dismissed.”

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 


Demurred to, whereas, as to Substance, it goes all the way back to the Declaration, since, as previously observed, a 
Special Demurrer includes a Genera Thus, to illustrate the point, if A puts in a Declaration Good in Substance, but 
Bad in Form, B puts in a Plea Good in Form and Bad in Substance, and A Demurs Specially, B wifi lose for two 
reasons, one because the Defect in Form in A’s Declaration is not open on A’s Special Demurrer; it was waived by 
B’s failure to Demur Specially at the Second Stage of Pleading; two, because B was Guilty of the First Substantive 
Defect, which was available even on .4’s Special Demurrer, which included a General, and without regard to the 
Formal Defect in A's Declaration.” 

The Rule that a Demurrer will open up the Record back to the Declaration so as to cause Judgment to be 
rendered against the First Party guilty of a Substantive Defect, however, may, at Common Law, be subject to at least 
four Exceptions. 

Exceptions to the Oetterai Rule 

The first Exception occurs where the plaintiff Demurs to a Plea in Abatement. Thus, for instance, let us suppose 
that A sues in Ejectment, but fails to allege Title, that .8 pleads that he was sued in the wrong County, but fails to 
give the plaintiff a better Writ, or to tell him in what County he might be sued in. This is a Plea in Abatement, 
Defective in Form for failure to give the plaintiff a Better Writ. Now, suppose A Demurs Generally to the Plea. 
Does the Demurrer reach back to the Defect in the plaintiff s Declaration, that is, his Failure to allege Title, If it 
were permitted to do so, the defendant would win the case on the Merits, without having taken any chance of losing 
it on the Merits, as, with one Exception, on a Plea in Abatement the Judg 
ment is never on the Merits. In order to prevent the defendant from winning when, by his Plea hi Abatement he 
took no chance of losing on the Merits, an Exception to the Rule as to the retrospective effect of a Demurrer was 
created where the Demurrer was interposed to a Plea in Abatement, and where, to permit the Demurrer to search the 
Whole Record, would sooner or later, as illustrated by the case above, result in a victory for the defendant where he 
had no chance 

to lose.” 
The second Exception arises where there has been a discontinuance along one of several lines of Pleading. An 


example of this 
82. Professor Charles A, ICeigwin explains this point as follows: ‘Pleas in Abatement are not within the Operation of the Usual Ruie, and that for 
two reasons: (1) in Point of Policy such Pleas are discouraged, because odious in Law and often prejudicial to Justice; and (2) in Point of 


Principle, a flea in Abatement is addressed, not to the Declaration, but to the writ npon which the Declaration is based, and the Purpose of 
the Plea is to Abate or quash the Writ for some Defect in the framing of the case. Therefore, on Demurrer to a Flea in Abatement, the 
defendant cannot turn the Demurrer against the Declaration. Should the Plea be Replied to and the Replication Demurred to, the general 
principle operates so far as to carry the Demurrer back to the Plea, but not to make available any Objections to the Declaration.” Cases in 
Common Law Pleading. Ilk. II, The Rules of Pleading, 450 (2d ed. Rochester. 1934).

THE OEMTJRRER 


may be seen in the case of Tippet v. May,” in which the plaintiff declared in Assumpsit against A, B and C. Two of 
the defendants, A and B, pleaded a Debt of Record by way of set-off, without taking any notice of the third. The 
plaintiff Replied Nul Tiel Record, and gave a day to produce the Record to the two defendants A and B, but 
entered no suggestion on the roll respecting the third, 
C. To this Replication, there was a General Demurrer. The Court held that the plaintiffs having Replied to a Plea 
by two of the defendants without taking notice of the third against whom they declared, had made a discontinuance; 
that the Cause being discontinued, Judgment must be given against the plaintiffs, as they were not in a position to 
take advantage of the Defect in the defendant’s Plea.* To put the matter in another way, the plaintiffs, by neglecting 
to sign Judgment against the defendant, on Allegations the latter failed to answer, caused a Discontinuance of the 
Action. The principle involved was that the plaintiff, by omitting to follow up his entire demand against the three 
defendants, created an interruption in the proceedings, which is technically known as a “Discontinuance,” and which 
creates an Error on the Record. The commission of this fault places the plaintiff where he is in no position to ask for 
Judgment; but such an Error is now generally cured by ona of the Statutes of Jeofails,® after Verdict, as well as after 
Judgment. 

The third Exception may appear where a defendant interposes more than one Plea, one of which is a Plea of 


the General Issue, and there is a Demurrer at a later Stage in the Pleadings. However, in The Auburn c~ Owes-

plaintiff, to which Replication the defendant Demurred, the Court held that the Declaration was Bad in 
Substance, and that the Demurrer would Open Up the Record back to the Declaration; that the earlier case of

The earliest mention of this Rule In Illinois was in Brawner v. Lomsx, 2.3 In. 496 (1860), which was decided without any reference to the New 
York decisions. Wear v. Jacksonville & Savaonah It. F. Co., 24 MI. 5413 (1860), was decided against the Retrospective Effect of the Demurrer 
on the theory that a I’arty could not Plead and Demur at the Same Time to the Same Pleading. Other eflcr’s followed: Wilson v. Myriek, 26 II,

This wns riot, however, the rule in England. To the contrary, the Retroactive Operation of Demurrer wns consciously per,nitted by the English 
Ct,nrts in this instance. In an account of certain features of the Common Law Practice, it was nuthoritatively said in 1830: “The defendant 
occasionally resorts to the expedient of Pleading in addition to some Plea sufficient in Point of Law, another which he knows to he insufficient, 
but to contain a True Statement of Facts, He thus sometimes succeeds in compelling the plaintiff to take Issue in Fact upon the First Plea, and 
to Demur to the Second; and, as upon the Argument of the Demurrer, the Court looks to the Whole Record, and decides against the Party First 
In Fault, the defendaht, instead of supporting his Second Plea, attacks the Declaration, and thus, In effect, both Demurs and Pleadi to the 
Declaration.” Third Report of Commissioners on the Superior Courts of Commob Law, 26 (London, 1830).

well-established Rule that the defendant 
could not Both Plead and Demur to the same 
Count.*® 


The fourth Exception occurs where tile 

plaintiff Demurs to a Plea which has been 

entered by the defendant after his Demurrer 

to the Declaration has been overruled. Some 

Courts hold, as, for example, in Stearns v. 

88. In referring to this specific point, Bronson, C. J., observed: It is quite clear that the defendant cannot both Plead and Demur to the Same Count. 
And it is equally clear, that at the Common Law, lie could not have Two Pleas to the Same Count. Indeed the two things, though stated in 
different ‘verdi, are only parts of one Common-Law Rule; to wit, that the defendant cannot make Two Answers to the Same Pleading. The 
Statute c:f 4 and 5 Anne, e. 16, was made to remedy this inconvenience; and it allowed the defendant, with the leave of the Court, to Plead as 
many Several Matters as he should think necessary for his defence. With us, leave of the Court is no longer necessary. (2 ItS. 352, ~ 9). The 
Statute does not say that the defendant may both Plead and Demur; and consequently lie ep.unot make Two Such Answers. But he moy Plead 
Two or More Pleas; sonic of which may terminate in Issues of Fact, to be tried by a Jory; while others may result in Issues of Law, to be 
determined by the Court. And whenever we come to a Demurrer, whether it be to the Plea, Replication, Rejoinder, or still further onward, tile 
Rule is to give Judginert against the Party who committed the First Fault in Pleading, if the Fault be such as would maine the Pleading bad on 
General Demurrer. This finle has always prevailed. It was the Rule prior to the Statute of Anne; and to say that the defendant, because he 
Pleads Two Pleas, one of which results Ia a Demurrer, cannot go back and attack the Declaration, would he to deprive him of a portion of the 
privilege which the Legislature intended to confer. lie eannet Plead and Demur at the Same Time, because the Common Law forbids it; and the 
Statute does not allow it. But he may Plead Two fleas; and be takes the right with all its legitimate consequences; one of which is, that 
whenever there comes a Demurrer upon either of the two Lines of Pleading, be may run back upon that line to see which Party committed the 
First Fault; and against that Party Judgment will be rendered. Aside from the dicta in question, there is not a shadow of authority, either here or 
in England, for a different Doctrine.” The Auburn & Owasco Canal Co. t Lelteh, 4 DeMo (N.Y.) 65, 67 


(1847). 

Cope, that where the defendant has Dcmurred to the Declaration, his Demurrer has been overruled, and he has 
Pleaded over, an Exception is created to the General Rule, and the Court having once passed on the sufficiency of 
the Declaration, it is incompetent for the same tribunal, at a succeeding term 
to reverse the decision; also, that the defend- 
ant having submitted to the first decision, he thereby waived the Defect in the Declaration, if any. But in Cummins v. 
Gray,°° the oppo 
site view was taken. 
Where Plaintiff has not put his Action on the Proper Ground 

AS has been observed, the Court will generally consider the Whole Record, and give Judgment for the Party 
who, on the whole, appears entitled to it. But where, though the right, on the Whole Record, appears to be with the 
plaintiff, if he has not put his Action on that ground, the defendant will prevail. Thus, where, in an Action on 
a Covenant to perform an Award, and not to prevent the arbitrators from making 
it, the plaintiff Declared in Covenant, and 
Assigned, as a Breach, that the defendant 


Page 424 of 735 


would not pay the sum Awarded, and the 

defendant Pleaded a revocation of the au 

thority of the arbitrators by deed, before 

Award made, to which the plaintiff De 

murred, the Court held the Plea good as being a sufficient answer to the Breach alleged, and therefore gave 

Judgment for the defendant, although they were of opinion that the matter stated in the Plea would have entitled the 

plaintiff to maintain his 

Action if he had alleged, by way of Breach, 

89. 109 Ill. 340 (1854). 

Bistorically, It may be said that no such Rule was developed by the English cases, and in Illinois, it originated with the ease of Brawner v. 
Lomax, 23 El, 496 (1860), although the Bale may have been foreshadowed In MeFaddea v Fortier, 20 III. 509 (1858). See, also, Bills v. 
Stanton, 69 M. 51 (1873).

that the defendant had prevented the arbi’. trators from making their Award.” 
JUDGMENT ON DEMURRER 
201. The Judgment rendered upon a Dcriurrer is the Judicial Determination by the Court, without a Jury, of 
an Issue of Law only. When rendered in favor of the Party Demurring to a Pleading-in-Chief, its effect is that of 
a Final Determination of the Merits of the Cause, unless, as is now generally allowable, the Pleading is 
Amended so as to obviate the objection. When rendered against the Parly Demurring, it was Final at Common 
Law, but lie is now permitted to Plead Over. And a Judgment on a Demurrer in Abatement is Final, but a Judgment 
on a Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement is not Final. 
The General Rule 
THE General Rule is that a Demurrer, either General or Special, follows the Nature 


Page 425 of 735 


of the Pleading Demurred to; and accordingly the result will be different where the Demurrer is directed to a 
Dilatory Plea as opposed to a Plea in Bar. 
Where the Demurrer is Directed to a Plea in Abatement 


THUS, a Judgment on a Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement, if for the defendant, is that the Writ be Quashed; If 
for the plaintiff, it is a Judgment of Respondeat Ouster, or that the defendant Answer Over,” 
Where the Demurrer is Directed to any Pleading in Chief 

WHERE the Demurrer is directed to any Pleadings-in-Chief, such as the Declaration, Plea in Bar, or other 
Subsequent Pleading, which goes to the Action, the Judgment is Final, that is, if for the plaintiff, quod recuperet; 
if for the defendant, guoci eat sine

die.” In other words, on Demurrer to any Pleadings which go to the Action, the Judgment for Either Party will, 
at Common Law, be the same as upon an Issue of Fact Joined upon the Same Pleading, and found in favor of the 
Same Party.°* At Common Law, in case of a Judgment in favor of the Party Demurring, it was Final against the 
Other Party, and disposed of the Action on the Merits. The latter could not Amend his Pleadings and go on with the 
Action. But in time the Rule was relaxed. Under Modem Practice and Statutes, generally the Courts will permit 
him to Amend. So, likewise, if the Judgment was against the Party Demurring, it was Final at Common Law.” In 
Modern Practice, however, and under the Statutes, it is otherwise, and he is very generally allowed to Plead Over 
on the Merits. 
Eflection to Stand on Demurrei~ 

IF, the Demurrer of a Party was overruled, and he was still of the opinion that he was correct on his theory of the 
Law, he might, as was said, Elect to “stand on his Demurrer,” or refuse to withdraw it and enter a Plea to the 


Merits. In such an event his next move was to seek a Review in the Appellate Court on a Writ of Error.°°

Where the Defendant Demurs in Abatement 

A Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement and a Demurrer in Abatement should be clearly distinguished. As previously 
observed the Statute of Elizabeth (1585) and the Statute of Anne (1705), did not apply to Pleas in Abatement, hence 
as before the Statutes, so, likewise, after the Statutes, a General Demurrer was sufficient to reach a Defect in Form 
in a Plea in Abatement.°’ And, as previously observed, the Judgment on a Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement was not 
Final. But where a defendant entered a Demurrer, and Assigned as Ground of his Demurrer, Matter which ought to 
have been Pleaded in Abatement, the Court gave a Final Judgment.” Contrary to the case of a Demurrer to a 
Plea in Abatement, in which case the Judgment is not Final, the Judgment on a Demurrer in Abatement is Final,” as 
a Demurrer cannot partake of the character of a Plea in Abatement.’ 
Effect of Judgment on Demurrer—Res Judicrzta 

IN those instances where, as observed, a Final Judgment is Rendered on a Demurrer, it is as Conclusive of the 
Facts confessed by the Demurrer as a Verdict finding the same Facts would have been, since they are established, in 


both cases, by Matter of Record. The Judgment in such case operates as an 
be implied, such as leave to Plead Over. Bennett v. Union Cent, Life Ins. Go., 203 111. 430, 67 N.E. 971 
(1903).

1. Since the abolition of Pleas in Abatement by the 


Code, Defects formerly available on this Plea arc 
now taken advantage of in the Answer. New York: 
Gardner v. Clark, 21 N.Y. 890 (1860); Oklahoma: 

Maxia v. Oklahoma Portland Genlent Co., 74 Okla. 
31, 176 P. 907 (1918). 


Estoppel, and Facts thus established can never afterwards be contested between the same Parties, or those in Privity 
with them, in another Suit.” If, therefore, on a Demurrer to a Declaration, Judgment is Rendered for the defendant, 
the plaintiff can never afterwards maintain against the same defendant, or those in Privity with him, any similar 
action upon the same Grounds as were disclosed in the First Declaration, unless such Judgment result from the 
Omission of an Essential Allegation. In the latter instance the Judgment would be No Bar to a Second Action 
supplying the Missing Allegation; nor is it a Bar, where the Action is misconceived, to an Action afterwards brought 
in proper form. The Ground upon which the Estoppel rests, in these instances, is a determination of the Merits of the 
Action, which, by Reason of the Admitted Facts shown upon the Record, the Unsuccessful Party is precluded from 
again bringing into question. And the result confirms the view that one of the Fundamental Functions of Pleading is 
to Preserve a Record of a Controversy once Litigated, in order to serve as a basis of a Plea of Res Judicata, and thus 
prevent the Relitigation of a Cause once settled.

THE DEMURRER

the Formal and Substantive Qualities of a pleading, has been abolished in some States, and replaced by the Motion, in 
lieu thereof. It seems doubtful whether the Change has been one other than in the name used to describe the Procedural 
Device by which an Objecting Party may Assert his Right to Refuse to An- 


swer. 
IN some States, under Modern Coées, Practice Acts, and Rules of Court, the Demurrer has been abolished,” but in 
lieu thereof the same Defects, formerly available on Demurrer, may generally be reached by Motion. 
Thus, in New Jersey, the Rules provided: Rule 26. “Demurrers Are Abolished. Any Pleading may be struck out 
on Motion on the Ground that it discloses no Cause of Action, Defense or Counterclaim respective 
ly. The Order made upon such Motion is Appealable after Final Judgment. In lieu of a Motion to Strike Out, the 


same Objection, and any Point of Law (other than a question of Pleading and Practice) may be raised in 
3. For an enumeration and discussion of Code provisiens Abolishing the Demurrer, see Clark, Handbook of tie Law of Code Pleading, c. A, § 86, 
pp. 535— 545 12d ed, St. Paul, 1947). 


the Answering Pleadings, and may be disposed of at, or after, the Trial; but the Court, on Motion of either Party, 
may determine the question so raised before Trial, and if the Decision be decisive of the whole case the Court 
may give Judgment for the Successful Party or make such order as may be Just.” 
Rule 27 provided: “Objections to Pleadings other than those provided for in Rule 26 above, shall be Made by 
Motion. The Action of the Court thereon is appealable after Final Judgment.” 
Rule 28 provided: “Every Motion addressed to a Pleading must present every Cause of Objection then existing.” 
How effective this Reform was is clearly seen in Savage v. Public Service Ry. Co.,” in which the plaintiff in a 
cause for personal 
injuries alleged that, as a passenger while standing on the rear platform of the car, about to enter the body of the said 
car, she was suddenly jerked from her feet and thrown to the floor of the car “by the negligent operation thereof.” 
After the Pleadings were completed, and the case came on for Trial, on the basis of a Reserved Right, the 
defendant Moved to Strike Out the Complaint on the Ground that the Complaint disclosed no Cause of Action; in 
that a General Allegation of Negligence was Insufficient. The Motion was sustained, Judgment was entered, 
whereupon the defendant Appealed. After adverting to the abolition of the Demurrer by the provisions as set out 
above, the Court then proceeded with the discussion of the Issue as to whether a General Allegation of Negligence 
was good as against the Motion. Chief Justice Gummere declared: 
“The question upon which the determination of this Appeal depends is whether the Complaint could have been 
successfully attacked by a General Demurrer, upon the Ground that it disclosed no Cause of Action; and we think 
that it must be answered in the

negative. In the case of Central Railroad Co. v. Van Horn, 38 N.J.L. 133, 138, the defendant interposed a Demurrer 
to the Second Count of a Declaration, which showed merely that the plaintiff was in one of the cars of the defendant 
company under a duty by it to carry her safely, and while there that she was, ‘through the negligence, carelessness 
and misdirection of the defendant and its agents and servants, thrown from and under the coaches of the said 
defendant.’ It svas held by the Supreme Court that, although this Averment was so uncertain and insufficient in 
detail as to afford the defendant little, if any, information as to what the Specific Act of Negligence was, or what 
agency of the company was responsible for it, it was clearly good on a General Demurrer, the Defect being one of 
Form and not of Substance. In Breese ‘s’. Trenton Horse Railroad Co., 52 Id. 250, 253, a Count which stated in 
General Terms that by the careless management of the car in a public street by the agents of the defendant it thereby 
ran over the body and arm of the plaintiff, was held good on a General Demurrer. In Race v. Easton and Amboy 
Railroad Co., 62 Ic!. 536, a Count in a Declaration simply Averring, in effect, that by reason of the negligent and 
improper running of defendant’s railroad train, and blowing of the whistle on its locomotive, a horse which was 
being driven on the highway by the plaintiff became frightened and overturned the wagon, and that plaintiff was 
thereby thrown out 

and injured, although not specific enough for a proper Pleading was permitted to stand as against a General 
Demurrer. Ferguson v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 64 Id. 222, is to the same effect. In Minnuci v. Philadelphia 
and Reading Railroad Co., 68 Id. 432, it was declared that an Averment in a Declaration which stated that the 
plaintiff’ s Injuries were caused solely by the negligence of the defendant, without more, although it did not fulfill 
the requirement of the Rule 

Ch.20 


of Pleading that the certainty of the Statement of the Plaintiff's Case must be such as in a reasonable measure to 
apprise the Defendant of the case to be made against him, was good on General Demurrer.” 

From the foregoing, it would seem clear that in New Jersey the abolition of the Demurrer, in effect, was in 
name only.” 


The Federal Solution of the Problem 

THE New Federal System,’ provides for the abolition of the Demurrer, and the Statement of All Defenses in 
Law or Fact in the Responsive Pleading, where one is required. It also permits certain Defenses to be raised by 
Motion, which may be heard and determined in advance of Trial, or the Court may order the hearing and 
determination of the Motion deferred until the Trial. 


Additionally, under the Federal Rules,t where a party contends that the opposing pleading has failed to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted, matter outside the pleading may be presented to and considered by the 
Court, and in such event the Motion will be treated as one for Summary Judgment. 


Page 429 of 735 


Effect of Reform Sum,nwrized 

WHAT, one may well ask, has been accomplished in the states by substituting the Motion in lieu of the 
Demurrer? At first glance, it may appear that this change has been quite sweeping in its effect, whereas, in fact, it 
is more of a change in Form than in Substance, because in order to determine the Scope of the substituted 
Motion, it is necessary to understand the Scope of the Demurrer, as it exists and operates at Common Law. Thus, if 
it be asked, what kind of Motions do we have, the answer is, the 
408 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS

same kind of Motions as we had Demurrers at Common Law, or General Motions reaching Substantive Defects, and 
Special Motions reaching Defects in Form. If it is asked, what does a Motion Admit, the answer is, it Admits 
substantially the Same Facts as were formerly Admitted by a Demurrer. If the question is, what Defects in Pleading 
may be reached by a Motion, the reply is, the Same Defects which, at Common Law, were available upon General 
or Special Demurrer. If it is inquired, how far does a Motion Open up the Record, the answer is, back to the 
Declaration or Complaint, just as the Demurrer did; and finally, if it be asked, what Exceptions are there to the 
General Rule as to the Retrospective Effect 

of the Motion, the answer is, the Same as at Common Law, in so far as those Exceptions are susceptible of 
application to a Code System of Pleading which ordinarily does not extend beyond the Replication Stage. 


It thus appears that, except for the change in nomenclature, or the substitution of the name “Motion” in place of 


the name “Demurrer”, and except for the fact that a Motion may come up f or Argument on five days notice, 
whereas a Demurrer came up for Argument on twenty days notice, there is in general no substantial difference 


between the Motion and the Demurrer, and it may be questioned whether sufficient gain has 
been registered to justify the change, with its resultant confusion and litigation.

alleged liability by some Form of Plea. Pleas are separated into Two Classes: first, Dilatory Pleas, or Pleas which 
seek to prevent a Final Judgment on the merits; 2 second, Peremptory Pleas, or Pleas more popularly known as Pleas 
in Bar, which seek to bring about a Final Judgment on the merits.’

PLEAS—DILATORY 
411 

Dilatory Pleas, with which we are concerned in this Chapter, may be divided into Three Classes: first, Pleas to 
the Jurisdiction and Venue of the Court; second, Pleas in Suspension of the Action; and third, Pleas in Abatement. 
Dilatory Pleas have sometimes been referred to by the generic name of Pleas in Abatement, but this term is more 
properly used to designate one of the classes into which Pleas of a Dilatory Nature are divided. 


The general effect of these Dilatory Pleas is to suspend or terminate the particular Suit, but to leave the cause 
undetermined on its merits. And this was on the basis that there was an objection to the Action grounded on 
principles of Remedial Law as opposed to Substantive Law. And it was necessary that they be Pleaded before Pleas 
in Bar, which dispose of the Action entirely. Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Court, the Service of Process, 
and the Venue, are more favorably regarded than Pleas in Abatement proper; they do not have to be Verified by 
Affidavit, nor give the plaintiff a better Writ, and they may be Amended like Pleas in Bar.* A mistake in the Formal 
Prayer for Relief in a Plea in Abatement is fatal to the Plea.” 


At Common Law, Pleas of every description were required to follow a certain order. 


4. Sinithl-lurd's Rev.St.Il.1021,c. 1, § 1: Spencer v. Aetna Indemnity Co., 231 Ill. 82, 83 N.E. 102, 12 Ann.Cas. 323 (1907). 


Though a Plea to the Jurisdictloa is not pruporly a Plea in Abatement, liko such a Plea, it should state what Court has Jurisdiction. .Minch & 
Eisenbrey Co. v. Cram, 138 Md. 122, 110 A. 204 (1920). 


In an Action of Trover the defendant’s Plea to the Jurisdiction on the ground that it was a foreign corporation without a place of business OT 
agent in the state was not -within the reason discouraging Dilatory Pleas, or one going merely to a Question of Venue within the State. Bank of 


Bristol v. Ash-worth, 122 Va. 170, 94 S.E. 469 (1917). 


~. Pitts Sons Mfg. Co. v, Commercial Nat. Bank, 121 Ill. 582, 13 NE, 156 (1857). 

Thus, Dilatory Pleas had to be Pleaded before Pleas in Bar, and even as between the different Dilatory Pleas, a 
certain order was required. A Plea to the Jurisdiction of the Person must be taken before the defendant Demurs, 
Moves, or Offers any other Plea, or he will submit himself to the Jurisdiction of the Court, 


TILE ORDER OF DILATORY PLEAS 
204. Dilatory Pleas must be Pleaded before any others. Matters of Defense, which tend only to delay or 
defeat the particular Suit, withaut destroying the plaintiff’s Right to Sue, must be presented Before Pleading 
to the Merits of the Action; the order of Pleading Dilatory 


Objections is in general as follows 


(I) Pleas to the Jurisdiction; 


(ID) Pleas in Abatement on Account of the Disability of the Plaintiff; 
(III) Pleas in Abatement on Account of the Disability of the Defendant; 


(IV) Pleas in Abatement for Defect of Parties; 


Page 432 of 735 


(1”) Pleas in Abatement for Pendency of Another Action. 


THE Law has prescribed and settled the Order of Pleading which the defendant should pursue, and although, in 
some respects, the division has been objected to as more subtle than useful, the arrangement given above is still 
adhered to? as will be seen from the Chart set forth on page 412: 


6. See the opinion of Chief Justice Bolt in Longue ville v. Inhabitants of Thlstleworth, 2 Ld.Raym. 969, 92 EngRep. 146 (1703); Co.Litt. 303a 
(PhLladelpliia, 1853). 


This Rule can have no application in Code Pleading, as an defenses are to be covered by the answer, save 
e the objections specified for the use of a Demurrer. 


In Equity Pleading, however, the analogy is plain, and a logical sequence of Pleas and Answers according to their object is, to a certain extent, 
still malntained.

The Order, as set out in the Chart above, has been said to be the Natural Order, since each Subseguent Plea 
admits that there is no foundation for the Preceding Plea, and precludes the defendant from afterwards availing 
himself of the Matter, as will be seen if the Order be inverted. A Plea to the Count or Declaration thus admits the 
Jurisdiction of the Court, and the ability of the plaintiff to sue mid the defendant to besued; and, after a Plea in Bar 
to the Action, the defendant cannot Plead in Abatement, unless for New Matter arising after the Commencement of 
the Action.”

PLEAS TO THE JURISDICTION 


205. A Plea to the Jurisdiction is one by which the defendant excepts to the Authority and Power of the 
Court to entertain the Action, either for Lack of Jurisdiction of the Subject-Matter, or for Lack of Jurisdiction of 


Page 433 of 735 


the Person of the Defendant. 


Definition and Classification 
A Plea to the Jurisdiction asserts, by Way of Denial, that a Specific Court has no Jurisdiction to try the Cause of 
Action presented by the plaintiff. 


In this connection, it is important to keep in mind that Courts are either of General or of Limited Jurisdiction. 
The first Type of Courts have Cognizance over all Transitory Actions, wherever the Cause of Action may have 
accrued, as All Actions of that kind generally follow the person of the defendant. The latter have Jurisdiction only 
over Causes of Action arising within Certain Local Limits.* Courts of General Jurisdiction have 


8. No fact necessary to confer Jurisdiction upon these Inferior Courts will be presumed, but everything must appear upon the Record. Clark v. 
Norton, 6 Minn. 412 ((311. 277) (1861). But see, Illinois: 
Renney v. Oreer, 13111. 432,54 Am.Dec. 439 (1851); 


Sec. 205 
PLEAS—DILATORY 
413 
no authority to try cases of a Local Nature arising in a Foreign Country or in any place where the Process of the 
Court cannot run. 


Pleas to the Jurisdiction of the Court were either one of Two Descriptions: first, that the person of the Party 
making the Plea was not subject to the Court’s Jurisdiction; second, that the Cause of Action was not subject to 
the Court’s Jurisdiction.” These will now be discussed. 


(I) Plea that the Court Has No Jurisdiction Over the Party Defendant.—Pleas of this character were limited in 
number, and frequently consisted in a right of the defendant to be exempted from liability to be sued in the 
Specific Court, as he was privileged to be exclusively sued in some other Court. The conclusion of such Pleas 
indicates that they should be Classed with Pleas to the Jurisdiction, but some authorities have Classed them with 
Pleas in Abatement to the person of the defendant'® According to Martin, “Pleas challenging the right of the 
plaintiff to sue on account of any disability are not properly classed with Pleas to the Jurisdic- but more properly 
belong to a certain Class of Pleas in Abatement yet to be considered.

—Pleas of this character were, according to Martin,” three in number: 


First, what may be determined privilege of tenure, under which fall Pleas of Ancient Demesne, a species of 
privileged tenure Cognimble only in the Court of the Manor of which the land sued for was held.” This type of 
Plea has no application in the United States. 


Second, Causes of Action arising out of the Local Limits of the Court’s Jurisdiction, as in Counties Palatine or 
other Inferior Courts of Local Jurisdiction.”* 


Third, want of power in the Court to take Jurisdiction over the Subject-Matter of the Action. When the Nature of 


Page 434 of 735 


the Action is such that the Court is under no circumstances competent to try, the objection may be, but need not 
necessarily be raised by a Plea to the Jurisdiction.” If the Court is totally without power to take Cognizance of the 
Subject-Matter, the Cause may be dismissed on Motion, or without Motion, cx officio, for the whole proceeding 
would be coram non judice [in presence of a person not a Judge] and utterly void.’ 


Requirements of Pleas to the Jurisdiction 
THE general Common-Law Rule was that 

Pleas to the Jurisdiction were PJeaded in Person and not by an Attorney, In Mostyn 

v. Fabrigas,” it was held that such a Plea

Under the Civil Code of Georgia, 2010, ~ 5605, requiring Special Pleas to the Jurisdiction unless want of Jurisdiction appears on 
the Face of the Proceedings, “Want of Jurlsdiètion” refers to Subject-Matter, not to the person. Thurman v. Willingbam, 18

should indicate another Jurisdiction in which the Action could be brought. Only Half Defenses were required, ® 
Formal Commencements were omitted, ° and such Pleas were concluded to the Cognizance of the Court by Praying 
Judgment, if the Court would take further Cognizance of the Action.”° Pleas to the Jurisdiction, except such as de- 
nied Jurisdiction over the Subject-Matter of the Action under any circumstances, were required to be Pleaded first in 
order, for if the Pleader raises any other question which the Court must of necessity pass upon, he admits the 
Jurisdiction, and cannot afterwards be heard to deny it.” This does not apply, of course, where the Court has No Ju- 
risdiction of the Subject-Matter. In such a ease, it cannot acquire Jurisdiction either by consent or waiver, and the 
objection of Want of Jurisdiction may be raised at any time.” If the Action was brought in a Court of Limited 
Jurisdiction, every Fact essential to sustain the Jurisdiction had to be stated in the Declaration; it would not be 
aided by presumptions.”

Methods of Taking Advantage of the Court’s Lack of Jurisdiction 

WHERE the Action was brought in a Court of Limited Jurisdiction, if the Facts necessary to show Jurisdiction, 
did not appear, such Defect could be reached by Demurrer. But the Rule was to the contrary in Courts of General 
Jurisdiction. In the latter case, the Jurisdiction was presumed, unless perchance the Declaration showed on its 
face that the Action arose in some Exclusive Jurisdiction, in which case a Demurrer was available. If, however, no 


Page 435 of 735 


Fact appeared in the Declaration which operated to rebut the Presumed Jurisdiction, the objection could be raised 
only by Plea, and such Plea, in order to measure up to the requirements of Good Pleading, was required to 
Negative Every Fact from which Jurisdiction might be presumed. 


Defects in the Service of Process, not Apparent on the Face of the Record or the Return of Service, should be 
raised by a Plea to the Jurisdiction of the Person, as, for example, where the Return of the Service is to be 
contradicted,” If the defendant wishes to object that the Court has not acquired Jurisdiction of his Person, owing to 
some Defect in the Service of the Summons, he should Appear in Person and not by Attorney,”

The Distinction Between Pleas to the Jurisdiction and Pleas in Abatement 
ACCORDING to Martin, Pleas to the Jurisdiction differed from Pleas in Abatement, in the following respects: 


First, in being always Pleaded in Person; 


second, in always requiring Half Defense, while some Pleas in Abatement were said to be good with Full 
Defense; and 


Tlyh'd, in Fraying Judgment, if the Court will take further Cognizance of the Action. 

In other respects, says Martin, in that they 
-abated the Writ or Action, they were essentially the same.” Some authorities have classed Pleas to the Jurisdiction 
with Pleas in Abatement, while others have treated them under both heads.

PLEAS JN ABATEMENT 


206, A Plea in Abatement"? is one that shows some ground for Abating or Defeating the Particular Aflion, 
without destroying the Right of Action itself. Matters in Abatement include: 
(I) Wrong Venue or Place of Trial; 


(ID The Personal Disability of one of 
the Parties to sue or be sued; 
(Li) That the Action is Prematurely Brought; 
(IV) The Pendency of Another Action for the sante cause; 
(V) Misnomer; 


(Vi) Nonjoinder or Misjoinder of Parties. 
The Situation Which Called for the Use of five Plea in Abatement 


WHERE a defendant, on examination of. the plaintiff s Declaration, perceives no ground for objecting to the 


Page 437 of 735 


Jurisdiction of the Court, but finds that matters exist by reason of which, though the Cause of Action is not 
affected, the present Suit cannot be maintained, he should Plead in Abatement.°° 


Definition and Effect 

PLEAS in Abatement are variously defined, depending upon their respective Classifications, but, broadly 
speaking, include all such Pleas as seek to defeat a Specific Ac.tion, yet merely delay or prevent the en- 
forcement of the Right of Action. By way of contrast, Pleas in Bar seek to bring about 


29. A Plea In Abatement has been defined by Martin as follows: “By a Plea In Abatement the defendant shows Matter to the Court why be should 
not be Impleaded or Sued; or if Impleaded, not in the manner and form employed by the plaintiff; and praying that the Writ or Plaint may 


Abate.” Martin, Cis’Il Proeednre at Oommon Law, c, X, Defences by Way of Dilatory Pleas, Art. IV, Pleas in Abatement, 210 (St. Pail, 
1905), citing Jacob, Dictionary, Abatement I. (London 2809); Comyn, Dig, “Abatement,” B. 1 (London, 1822). 


:3. As to the nature and effect of, and the necessity for, Pleas In Abatement, see Pltts Sons 1Mg. Co. v. Commercial flat, Bank, 121 111, 582, 13 
N.E. 156 


(1887). 
a Final Judgment on the merits on the Right of Action. 


If sustained, the effect of a Plea in Abatement is not to dispose of the Right of Action, either entirely, nor even 
as far as the Particular Court is concerned, as is the case with a Plea to the Jurisdiction; nor, on the other hand, is it 
merely to temporarily Suspend the Action, as is the case with a Plea in Suspension; but its effect, as observed 
above, is to defeat entirely that Particular Action, leaving the plaintiff free, however, to assert his Right of Action in 
Another Suit, and in the Same Court. It is sometimes said that the Plea merely tends to delay the Action, but this is 
inaccurate. It entirely defeats the Particular Action, but it merely delays the enforcement of the Rig/vt of Action, 
which, thereafter, may again be prosecuted, avoiding the Defect which led to the demise of the Particular 
Original Action. 


Classification of Pleas in Abatement 

IN any event the Writ, on which the plaintiff’s Cause of Action was grounded, was Abatable by a Plea 
formally attacking its suffiCiency, or by a Plea to the Person suing or to the Person sued, showing that No Writ 
should have been issued in favor of the plaintiff or against the defendant. In accordance with this broad view, Picas 
in Abatement were classified as follows: 


First, Pleas relating to the Writ, as to the Form of It and to the Action of It; ~ 
Second, Pleas relating to the Count or DecJaration; 


Third, Pleas relating either to the Disability of the Person of the Plaintiff or the Person of the Defendant.

PLEAS—DILATORY 
417 

If ground for Abating the Action Appears on the Face of the Declaration or Record, a Plea in Abatement is not 
necessary, for the objection may be raised by Demurrer or Motion to Quash; but if the matter does not so Appear, 
and Extrinsic Facts are necessary to be shown, a Plea in Abatement is essential.” 


(1) Pleas in Abatement to the Original Writ or Eill—According to Stephen,” a Plea in Abatement of the Writ was 
one which showed some ground for Abating or Quashing the Original Writ, and made a Prayer to that effect. Any 
Matters of Fact tending to impeach the correctness of the Original Writ, that is, to show that it was improperly fram- 
ed or sued out, without, at the same time, tending to deny the Right of Action itself, constituted sufficient ground for 
Abating the Writ. Such a Plea might be as to the Form of the Writ or to the Action of it. 


Page 438 of 735 


Thus, for example, if there was a Variance between the Charge contained in the Original Writ and the Charge 
appearing in the Declaration, that discrepancy showed that the Original Writ was not properly adapted to the Action, 
and it was, therefore, a ground for Abatement. 


And where the Writ appeared to have been sued out pending another Action already brought for the Same Cause, 
if it nam 


32. Thus, any defect in the Writ, its service or return, which is apparent from an Inspection of the Record, may properly be taken advantage of by 
Motion; but where the Objection is founded upon extrinsic facts, or outside of the record, as that the defendant was exempt from service, the 
Matter must be Pleaded in Abatement, so that an Issue may be made thereon, and tried, if desired, by a Jury, like any other Issue of Fact. Creer 
i’. Young, 120 111. 184, 11 N.E. 167 (1857). 


Pendency of another Action for the Same Cause must be Pleaded In Abatement. Moore v. Spiegel, 143 Mass. 413, 9 N.E. 827 (1887).

ed only one person as the defendant, when it should have named several, or if it appeared to have been defaced in a 


material part, it was Abatable. 


The objection that there was a Variance between the Original Writ and the Declaration was conditioned upon 
obtaining Oyer of the Writ. This Form of Objection, however, came into question when, during the reigns of George 
N (1727—1760) and George HI (1760—1820), the Courts of Common Pleas and King’s Bench adopted a Rule 
under which Oyer of the Original Writ was denied. The practical effect of this was to abolish Pleas in Abatement 
grounded on a Variance between the Original Writ and the Declaration.*' All other Pleas in Abatement, which could 
not be Verified without benefit of Oyer of the Original Writ, were also necessarily abolished,” but this Rule had no 
application to Actions Commenced by Bill. 


After this development, Pleas of this character, according to Chitty, were termed Pleas in Abatement rather from 
their effect upon the Writ than from any direct attack upon it, as under the early Common Law Rule.” Martin points 
out that where the Declaration, which was presumed to correspond with the Original Writ, was incorrect as to some 
Extrinsic Matter, it then became possible for the defendant to Plead in Abatement to the Writ through the medium 
of the Declaration.” 


As to the Form of the Writ, Pleas in Abatement were grounded principally on Misnom

er’, Nonjoinder, Misjoinder, or that the plaintiffs or defendants suing or being sued as husband and wife were 
not married. 


As to the Action of the Writ, the principal grounds for a Plea in Abatement were that the Action had been 
prematurely brought, that Another Action was pending for the Same Cause, in the same Court, or in any other 
Superior Court,” or that there has been a Misconception of the Cause of Action. ti, however, such Misconception 
was Apparent on the Face of the Declaration, it might also be taken advantage of by a Demurrer, and if not Apparent

on the Face of the Declaration, under a Plea of the General Issue.” 


(U) Pleas in Abatement to the Count or Declaration.—A Plea in Abatement to the Count or Declaration is one 
which is founded on some Defect applying immediately to the 
Declaration, and only by indirect consequences affecting the Original Writ. Under the early Common Law, many 
matters might be Pleaded in Abatement of the Count or Declaration in Actions begun by an Original Writ. The basis 
of Pleas of this character was principally some Defect, Informality or Mistake appearing in the Recital of the Writ in 
the Declaration, which was deemed essential in all cases, or upon a Variance between the Writ as recited and 
the Count or Declaration, Such Pleas, therefore, although they were primarily directed against the Count or 
Declaration, and were denominated as Pleas to the Count or Declaration, indirectly referred to the Original Writ as 
recited therein.“

41 On a Plea in Abatement on the Ground of a Variance between the summons, which, in our country, took the place of the Original Writ, and 
the Declaration, see; Ilinois: Snell v. Stanley, 63 Ill. 891 (1872); West VIrginia: Anderson v. Lewls, 64 W. Va. 297, 61 S,E. 160 (1908). 


In 1654 the Court of Common Pleas adopted a Rule of Court, ordering that Declarations in Actions on the 
Case, and upon General Statutes, except for Debt, should no longer recite the Original Writ, but only the Nature of 
the Action.” As a result of this development, Pleas in Abatement founded on what appeared only in the recital in 
the Writ, were abolished. The objection of a variance between the Writ and the Declaration could not thereafter 
be taken advantage of except by obtaining Oyer of the Original Writ. And when, by later Rule of Court, Oyer 
of the Original Writ was denied, Pleas in Abatement on the ground of a Variance between the Original Writ and the 
Count or Declaration, disappeared. But for some time thereafter, it was possible to plead in Abatement to the Writ 
through the medium of the DeclarationA* 


(Ill) Picas in Abatement to the Disability of the Person of the Plaintiff.—A Plea in Abatement to the Disability of 
the Person of the plaintiff or defendant was one which showed some personal legal disability in one of the Two 
Parties to Sue or Be Sued.” As to the plaintiff, such Pleas originally largely consisted of Pleas denying the existence 
of the plaintiff as a Person, setting up his Disability to Sue by reason of his being an alien in amity, or in 
enmity, his outlawry upon Mesne or Final Process, his Attainder for Felony or Treason, his Infancy when 
appearing otherwise than by Guardian or Next

Friend, or his death.*° When a female plaintiff sued otherwise than as a co-plaintiff with her husband, her 
Coverture was available in Abatement.“ 


(IV) Pleas in Abatement to the Disability of the Person of the Defendant.—As to the defendant, Pleas in 
Abatement included such Pleas as Coverture and Infancy. 


The Defense of Coverture did not amount to a Denial of the Liability of the defendant on the Cause of Action 
involved, which might be opposed by a Plea in Bar; it merely questioned her liability to be Sued without the Joinder 


Page 440 of 735 


of her husband.*® 


Anciently, Infancy was Pleadable in Suspension in certain Real Actions. This was also true in Debt, when the 
infant was Sued as heir on the Specialty or Sealed Obligation of his ancestor, in which case it was held that the 
Parol might Demur, that is, that the Pleadings might be Stayed until he had attained his full age.” Such right, 
however, never extended to an infant devisee, and in the year 1830, it was completely abolished by Section 10 
of Chapter 47 of the Statute of 1 Wm. W, 70 Statutes at Large 295 (18~30). 


Finally, with respect to these Pleas to the 
Person, it should be observed that they do 
not fall strictly within the Scope of Pleas in 
Abatement, for they do not Pray “that the 
Writ be Quashed,” but Pray Judgment “if

and do not deny the Right of Action itself, they are considerecl as in the Nature of Pleas of Abatement, and classed 

among them. 


As stated before, the effect of all Pleas in Abatement, if successful, is that the Particular Action is defeated, but 
the Right of Action itself is not gone; and the plaintiff, on obtaining a Better Form of Writ, may maintain a New 
Action, if the Objection was Grounded on Matter of Abatement; or, if the Objection were to the Disability of the

The Grounds of Abatement Under Modern Law 

AS the Original Writ has not been adopted as such in the United States, it is not proper to speak of a Plea in 
Abatement “of the Writ.” It is a Plea in Abatement “of the Action.” A Plea that an Action is brought in the Wrong 
County or the Wrong District, is generally regarded as Matter of Abatement and does not go to the Jurisdiction of 
the Court.” 


As we have no Original Writs, the Modern Grounds for Abatement of an Action are much more limited than they 
were formerly, and they have been further limited in most States by Statute, 


The principal Grounds of Abatement under Modern Law are: That the Action is prematurely brought; ~ the 
Pendency of An-

And a flea in Abatement setting up the defendant’s right to be Sued in the County of his residence, other than tbat in which the Action is

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Clit. 21 

AT Common Law there appears to have been some doubt as to the correct method for placing in Issue the 
Corporate Existence of the Plaintiff. Thus, in the case of Boston Type c~ Stereotype Foundry v. Spooner, -in which 
the plaintiff brought an Action of Assumpsit, but made no Allegation as to its Incorporation, the defendant Pleaded 
in Abatement that there never was a person in being called or known by name of Boston Type & Stereotype 
Foundry, to which the plaintiff interposed a Demurrer, upon which a Judgment of Respondeat Ouster was rendered. 
The defendant Excepted and the Issue presented was whether the facts set forth in the Plea were the proper subject 
of a Plea in Abatement. 


Before answering this Issue, a few preliminary observations may be helpful. The defendant should not be 
compelled to answer an Action unless it prosecuted in the name of a person, either Artificial or Natural, against 
whom he may have a Judgment, and an Execution. But how is he to Plead to bring this end about? As a General 
Rule, Matter in Bar cannot be Pleaded in Abatement, but to this Rule there are exceptions. Thus, the Nonjoinder of 
a Party Plaintiff may be Pleaded in Abatement, or taken advantage of under a Plea of the General Issue, which is a 
Plea in Bar; in Replevin, the defendant may Plead property in himself or a stranger, either in Abatement or in Bar; 
and certain personal disabilities which entirely defeat the Suit may be Pleaded in Abatement or in Bar, such as Alien 
Enemy, Attainder, Felony and Outlawry. 


So, in the instant ease, it appears that the defendant’s effort to reach a Lack of the Corporate Existence of the 
plaintiff was a proper subject for either a Plea in Abatement or Bar; that is, the Plea might be directed to the 
disability of a plaintiff, denying 


~3.5 Vt. 93 (1823). See, In this connection, Comment, Pleading—Necessity to Plead Corporate Capacity, 22 MI chij,Rev. 175 (1923). 

his existence, showing that there was no such person in rerum natura, as that at the Commencement of the Suit he 
was a Fictitious Person,™ or he may have Pleaded the Same Matter in Bar.” It follows, therefore, that the position of 
the Counsel for the plaintiff in the instant case, that the defendant could only avail himself of this Defense by Plea in 
Bar, is erroneous. And the objection that the defendant could not give a Better Writ is met by the fact that the Rule 
requiring the defendant to give the plaintiff a Better Writ has no application where a plaintiff, as in this case, 
cannot have a Better Writ, as there was no such person in existence. 


Notwithstanding the above observations, there are two views as to whether the Corporate Existence of a 
Corporation was in Issue under a Plea of the General Issue. The generally accepted view was that the Existence of 


Page 444 of 735 


the Corporation was not put in issue by a Plea of the General Issue. This appears to be the better view, as the 
function of the General Issue was to deny Material Allegations of Fact in the plaintiff s Declaration. If the Corporate 
Existence of the plaintiff were put in Issue the General Issue would be placing in Issue a Question of Law, as the 
Corporate Existence of the plaintiff can only be determined by construing the Charter of Incorporation, and 
Construction of a written document involves a Question of Law. The General Issue alone, therefore, should operate 
as an admission of the Corporate Existence of the plaintiff; seif it

was desirable to place it in Issue the defendant should Specifically Traverse the Corporate Existence of the plaintiff 
by use of the Plea of Nul Tie? Corporation.” 


And the same principles operate where a defendant Pleads the General Issue to an Action brought by an 
Executor,°~ the Authority of the Plaintiff being admitted by the Plea.°° 


As we have seen all Matter of a Dilatory Character must be Pleaded before entering a Plea in Bar, and by a 
separate Plea limited to the purpose or delaying the Action. Nor was it possible to Plead to the Jurisdiction or in 
Abatement while Pleading in Bar, or in any manner affecting the Merits of the Cause.’° And, of course, as may be 
seen from a glance at the chart on the General Order in which Pleas may be Pleaded, it is clear that any Plea, which 
contains Matter in Bar of the Action, constitutes a Waiver of all Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Court and to 
the Manner of Framing the Action.” Thus, a Plea of the General Issue, as we observed in discussing how the Cor- 
porate Existence of a Corporation might be placed in Jssue, admits the competency of 


that the plaintiff is a corporation is a Plea in Bar, hut a Plea denying that the defendant is a corporation is a Plea in Abatement.

THE Rules of the Common Law were strict as to the Persons who should be joined as Parties to the Action. Since 
the objection for Defect of Parties must sometimes be taken by Plea in Abatement, it is convenient to deal in this 
chapter with the Rules as to Parties and the consequences of Nonjoinder and Misjoinder, and how the Objection may 
be raised. 


Non joinder of Plaintiffs in Contract 
ALL Joint Contractors, such as Joint Promisees, Covenantees, or Obligees, and all Active Partners, should Join in 
Suits for Breach of Contract to which they are Parties.” 


All Persons who were Partners in a Firm when a Contract was made must be Joined, unless some legal excuse for 
Not Joining them is alleged, as that a Partner is dead. It is no excuse for Nonjoinder that one of

the Partners has sold his interest in a Contract to the others.~ 


If one of Several Joint Parties die, the character of the interest is still preserved, and the Right of Action must be 
exercised by the survivors as such, or, if all be dead, by the Personal Representatives of the last survivor,’ who, 
though thus excluding the Executors or Administrators of the other deceased Parties from maintaining the Action, is 
still liable to them in an Equitable Proceeding for the proportionate share belonging to the estate represented by 
each. ° 


When a person who ought to Join as plaintiff is omitted in an Action of Contract, if the Defect appears upon the 
Pleadings, the defendant may Demur, Move in Arrest of Judgment, or bring a Writ of Error. If it does not appear 
upon the Pleadings, but is disclosed by the evidence, the plaintiff will be Non-suited. It is not necessary to take the 
Objection by Plea in Abatement, though this may be done. 


A Nonjoinder of Joint Contractors as plaintiffs is a fatal error, unless Amended, t.nd may be shown under the

Mis joinder of Plaintiffs in Contract 

A Misjoinder of Plaintiffs is, unless Amended, fatal, and defendant may take advantage of it at any time.®°

Nonjo inder of Defendants in Contract 

ALL persons with whom a Contract is made must be Joined as Defendants in an Action for the Breach. Where 
Several Persons are Jointly Liable on a Contract, they must all be made defendants. Joint Contractors must be 
Sued Jointly, except that Joinder may be excused:

Nonjoinder of Joint Contractors as Defendants must be Pleaded in Abatement, unless the Joint Liability appears

It has been held that the fact that plaintiff merely filed the Common Counts with an Affidavit of Claim does not 
change the Rule requiring a Plea in Abatement, since a Bill of Particulars may be demanded. The General Issue 
admits that there is no foundation for a Plea of Nonjoinder.** 


82. 1 Chitty, On Pleading, e. I, Of the Parties to Actions, 42 (13th Am. ed., Springfield, 1859). 


Statutes now frequently declare that Contracts in terms Joint shall, in effect, be Joint and Several. Stimson, American Statute Law, 4113

the Nonjoinder of B ens be taken advantage of only by a Plea In Abatement. Pearce v. Pearce, 67 111. 207 (1873); Ross v. Allen, 67 Ill. 317 
(1873); Wilson v. Wilson, 125 IILApp. 389 (2907). 
Where the Declaration shows on its Face a Nonjoinder of Joint Contractors as Defendants, defendant may take 
advantage of the Nonjoinder by Demurrer, Motion in Arrest, or by Writ of Error, without a Plea in Abatement. 
There is a presumption that any partner omitted is still living.” 


A material distinction is to be noted between the case of Nonjoinder of Plaintiffs and Defendants in Actions cx 
contra cUt, the remedy for Nonjoinder of Defendants being generally restricted to the use of a Plea in Abatement,’ 
except in the ease of an express showing by the plaintiff as above indicated, when the defendant may Demur, Move 
in Arrest of Judgment, or support a Writ of Error.” The more liberal rule prevails where the fault is in making too 
many Parties defendant, though in all cases it is a serious one. 


In Actions of Tort, unless the case is one where, in point of Fact and of Law, the Tort could not have been Joint ~ 
(though even here an Objection would be aided by the plaintiffs taking a Verdict against one only), the Joinder of 
More Than are Liable constitutes No Objection to a partial recov

ery; ~ and as a Tort is in its nature a separate act of each individual concerned, and the plaintiff may therefore Elect 
to sue One or An, at his pleasure, the omission of one or more does not afford the defendant a Ground of 
Objection.” This Rule, however, holds only in cases of Actions for Torts strictly unconnected with Contract; as, if 
arising out of Contract, and, to support them, the Contract must be proved and is thus the basis of the Suit, 
Different Rules apply, and the mere Form of the Action will not gayem.” The application of the proper Rule, 
however, will depend upon the Statement of the Gist of the Action, as shown by the Declaration. 


Misjoinder of Defendants in Contract 

A Misjoinder of Defendants is, unless corrected, fatal. An Action against Several Persons must be established 
against them all, and, where the evidence shows that defendants are not Jointly Liable, failure to interpose a Plea 
denying Joint Liability will not permit a Joint Recovery.

Upon a Joint Tort is no ground of Objection in any Mode by those properly made Defendants. 


Non joinder of Plaintiffs in Tort Gives Rise 
to a Plea in Abatement 


THE proper plaintiffs in a tort Action for injuries to property are MI the Joint Owners; but where the remedy 
seeks the recovery of Damages, and not the Speeiflc Thing, the Nonjoinder of one or more of the Joint Owners can 
only be taken advantage of to defeat the Action by Plea of Abatement.” 


If a Plea in Abatement is not interposed to prevent the severance of the Joint Cause of Action in Tort, the plaintiff 
may recover according to his proportionate interest in the property, and the other Joint Owners Not Joined may 
afterwards sue and recover their proportion of the whole Damages.” 


Misjoinder of Plaintiffs in Tort 
A Misjoinder of plaintiffs in Tort, as well as in Contract, is ground for Nonsuit on the Trial,” It has been held

band and wife sue together only when there is a Joint Interest.” But at Common Law a married woman could not 


sue or be sued without having her husband Joined with her as a Party, and this is 8till the Rule in Some States. 


Nonjoinder or Misjoinder of Defendants in Tort 

A Nonjoinder or Misjoinder of Joint Tortfeasors as Defendants is no error, “Several persons acting 
independently, but causing together a single injury, may be Sued either Jointly or Severally) and the injured party 
may, at his Election, sue any of them Separately, or he may sue All or Any Number of them Jointly. If he sues all, he 


» 07 


may, at any time before Judgment, dismiss as to either or any of the defendants, and proceed as to the others”. 


The legal nature of a Tort is such that it may generally be treated as either Joint or Several, and all the 
wrongdoers are liable individually and collectively for the consequences of their acts, and all may be sued Jointly, or 
Any Number Less Than the Whole, or each may be sued Separately. Each is liable for himself, as the entire Damage 
sustained was thus occasioned, each sanctioning the acts of the others, so that, by suing one alone, he is not charged 
beyond his just proportion. It seems, however, that No Joint Action can be maintained for a Joint Slander, though 
it is difficult to see, upon principle, why one uniting with another in an agreement that the slanderous words should 
be spoken should not be as much liable as any one of several trespassers where the actual blow was given by one 
alone. Defendants in Actions cx delicto can generally

Misnomer in the Christian name of the defendant be Pleaded in Abatement, the defendant must in such Plea show 
what his true Christian name is, This requirement of this Rule has often been made the test by which to distinguish 
whether a given matter should be Pleaded in Abatement or in Bar, The lattcr Plea, as impugning the Right of Action 
altogether, can, of course, give No Better Writ, as its effect is to deny that, under any Form of Writ, the plaintiff 
should recover in such Action. If, therefore, a Better Writ can be given, it shows that the Plea should be in 
Abatement, and not in Bar, 


Matter in Abatement must be set up by Plea in Abatement, and not by a Plea in Bar. In other words, whenever the 
subject-matter to be Pleaded is to the effect that the plaintiff cannot maintain Any Action at any time, it must be 
Pleaded in Bar; but matter which merely defeats the Present Action, and does not show that the plaintiff is forever 
concluded, none! be Pleaded in Abatement. Matter in Abatement set up in a Plea in Bar cannot be considered in 
Abatement. 


In an Action on a Promissory Note the defendant Pleaded in Bar, not denying that he owed the note, but 
suggesting that it was not yet due. A Demurrer to the Plea was sustained, and, on the defendant’s Election to stand 
by the Plea, Final Judgment was Entered against him. This was held proper, as the matter was in Abatement, arid

postpone or Suspend the Action. This characteristic is responsible for the Classification of such Pleas as distinct 
from Pleas in Abatement. When the Ground for Not Proceeding with the Action is removed, the plaintiff is 
permitted to go on with it, without the necessity of bringing a New Action. 


Where an infant heir was Sued on a Specialty Debt of his deceased ancestor, he Pleaded his Nonage, not as a Ear 
or Defense, but merely in Suspension of the Proceedings until he should arrive at full age, whereupon the plaintiff 
could proceed with his Action. This was called a “Parol Demurrer,” the meaning of which was that the Pleading 
should be Stayed.” By the Section 10 of Chapter 47 of the Statute of 1 Wm. IV, 70 Statutes at Large 295 (1830), the 
Parol Demurrer was abolished.

Aid-Prayer and the Excommunication of the Plaintiff were subjects for Pleas in Suspension, but since the number 
of such Pleas was small and the Suspension of the Action was similar to an Abatement of the Suit until some future 
time or event, such distinction has not always served to distinguish them from Pleas in Abatement.” 


In Massachusetts, it was held that a Plea that the plaintiff is an Alien Enemy, though it may be either in 
Abatement or in Bar in a Reai Action, is merely in Suspension in a Personal Action, as it sets up merely a temporary 
disability of the plaintiff, which ceases with the war. Said the Court in the Massachusetts Case, “It is still called a 
Plea in Abatement, although the effect of it is not to Abate the Writ, or defeat the Process entirely, but to Suspend It; 
and the Plea is defective, when it concludes either in Bar or in Abatement of the Writ. The Form is a Prayer, whether 
the plaintiff shall be Further Answered; and the Judgment to be Entered upon it, when it shall be Confessed or 
Maintained, is, that the Writ aforesaid remain without day, donec terrac fuerint communes, until the intercourse or 
peace of the two countries shall be restored. Where the effect of a Plea is a temporary disability of the plaintiff, and 
nothing more, a Prayer of Judgment of the Writ is bad.”

(3d ed. by Ballantine, St. Paul, 1923). 


JUDGMENT ON DILATORY PLEAS 

212. if a Demurrer is sustained to a Plea to the Jurisdiction or to a Plea in Abatement, the Judgment is Respondeat 
Ouster, and the defendant may Plead to the Action, If an Issue of Fact is joined, and the Jury find against the 
defendant, they assess damages for the plaintiff. If an Issue either of Law or Fact, upon a Plea in Abatement, is found 
for the defendant, the Judgment is that the Writ be Quashed. 


WHERE a Plea to the Jurisdiction or a Plea in Abatement is found in favor of the defendant upon either an Issue 
of Fact or Law, the Judgment was that the Writ or Bill, as the case might be, should be Abated or Quashed. If the 
Plaintiff prevailed upon a Demurrer to the Plea, the Judgment was Interlocutory in Character, that is, Respondeat 
Ouster, or let the defendant answer over. Where an Issue of Fact was joined, and it was found in favor of the 
plaintiff, that is, that the defendant’s Plea was false, a Final 
Judgment was immediately awarded in his favor on the merits. The purpose of this Rule, obviously, was to 
discourage False Dilatory Pleas, and ft made it possible for the plaintiff in this single instance to Win on the Merits, 
without a Trial of the Issues raised in the Declaration. In no other instance may a party Win on the Merits on a 
Dilatory Plea? 


FORMAL COMMENCEMENT AND 
CONCLUSION 


213. Dilatory Pleas must be Framed with Great Strictness and with a Formal Conclusion. 


WI-tETHER a Plea is in Abatement or in Bar is to be determined, not from the Subject-Matter of the Plea, but 
from its Form,— its Conclusion. The Prayer of the Plea—the

See !t13’el’s & Waterson v. Hunter Erwin & CO,, 20 Ohio 382, 387 (1851), note: ‘I. The Judgment on a Plea in Abatement is either (1) that 
the Writ or Deeiaratioa he quashed (caneter breve, «nO,r&t/o) 
(2) Ilespondeat Ouster; and (3) Final (quod , ‘ecupcret), Judgment is rendered either (1) without Issue taken on the Plea; or (2) With Issue.

II. Issues on Pleas in Abatemellt are elther (I) such as must be tried by the Court; oF (2~ such as may be tried either by the Court or Jury. 
The kind or form of Judgment, rendered on n~, Issue upon a Plea In Abatement, depends upon the question whether the Issue ho found (1) for 
the plaintiff, and against the Plea; or (2) for the defe,,dant, and In Favor of the Pica.” 


Sec. 213 
PLEAS—DILATORY

advantage or relief sought—determines its character. “It would be both illogical and absurd, in a Plea in Bar, to 
Pray, as in a Plea in Abatement to the Count or Declaration, ‘Judgment of the said Writ and Declaration, and that the 
same may be Quashed’ ; and, as only the relief asked can be awarded, a mistake in this regard is fatal to the Plea. 
And hence the Rule that a Plea beginning in Bar and ending in Abatement is in Abatement, and, though beginning in 
Abatement and ending in Bar, is in Bar; so a Plea beginning and ending in Abatement is in Abatement, though its 
Subject-Matter be in Bar, and a Plea beginning and ending in Bar is in Bar, though its Subject-Matter is in 
Abatement. (Comyns’ Digest, title “Abatement”, b. 2.) With respect to all Dilatory Pleas, the Rule requiring them to 
be framed with the utmost strictness and exactness is founded in wisdom. It says to the defendant: ‘If you will not 
address yourself to the justness and merits of the plaintiff s demand, and appeal to the Forms of Law, you shall be 
judged by the Strict Letter of the Law.’ And so it has been held that a Plea in Abatement concluding, ‘wherefore he 
Prays Judgment if the said plaintiff ought to have or maintain his aforesaid Action against him,’ etc. (a Conclusion 
in Bar), is bad.” 10 


Pleas in Bar do not require the same degree of certainty as a Plea in Abatement, for being addressed to the 
justness of the plaintiff s claim, they are favored by the Courts. Certainty to a common intent, therefore, is all that is 
required. A Plea in Abatement containing a wrong Prayer is bad, but it has been held that the Conclusion or Prayer 
of a Plea in Bar is not material; that “there is a distinction between a Plea in Bar and a Plea in Abatement,—in the 
former the Party

A Plea to the Jurisdiction usually commences without any prayer for judgment.” Its Conclusion is as follows: -... 
the said C. D. Prays Judgment if the Court will or ought to have further Cognizance of the Suit; «3 or, in some cases, 


the defendant Prays Judgment “whether lie ought to be compelled to answer”.”* 


A Plea in Suspension seems also to be in general Pleaded without a Formal Commencement. Its Conclusion, in 


the case of a Plea of Nonage, is that the Parol shall Demur, or the proceedings be stayed, until the defendant comes 
of Full Age.”

STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 


214. In some states Pleas in Abatement have been abolished, and defects formerly available on such a Plea are 
reached either by a Motion or by an Answer in the Nature of a Plea in Abatement. 
In England 


AT Common Law there was no requirement as to Verification of either Pleas to the Jurisdiction or Pleas in 


Abatement. But the Statute of 4 Anne, c. 16, § 11, 11 Statutes at Large 157 (1705) provided that “no Dilatory Plea 
shall be received in any Court of Record, unless the Party offering such Plea, do, by Affidavit,” prove the truth 
thereof, or show some probable matter to the Court to induce them to believe that the Fact of such Dilatory Plea is 
true.” The Affidavit as to Truth required by this Statute might be made by the defendant himself, or by a third 
person; and as the Statute required only probable cause, there was no necessity for an Affidavit, where the Plea was 
for Matter Apparent. 


And in 1SS3, by the Statute of 3 & 4 Wm. lv, c. 42, $ 8, 73 Statutes at Large 275, it was provided that no Plea 
in Abatement for

the Nonjoinder of any Person as a Co-defendant should be permitted, unless it appeared from the Plea that such 
Person Resided Within the Jurisdiction, and that his residence was set out in the Affidavit Verifying the Plea. 
Section 9, of the Same Statute, allowed a Discharge in Bankruptcy to be Pleaded in Reply to a Plea of the Non- 
joinder of Another Person. And by Section 11 of the Same Statute, Pleas in Abatement for Misnomer were 
abolished in all Personal Actions. The remedy substituted was by Summons to require the plaintiff to Amend his 
Declaration by inserting the correct name, supported by an Affidavit. 


Fleas in Abatement for the Misjoinder and Nonjoinder could be responded to by amendment under the 
Common Law Procedure Act of 1852.20 


Under Sections 135 to 142 of the Same Statute, the effect of Abatement, as well as the liability to Abate by 


reason of Bankruptcy, Death and Marriage, were relieved against by provisions under which the Suit might be 
continued, in all cases in which the Cause of Action survived against or for the benefit of others.

In the Several States of the U,ñted States 


THE Statute of 4 Anne, e. 16, $ 11, 11 Statutes at Large 157 (1705), which reguired Verification of Dilatory 
Pleas, was considered as effective in the Several States of the United States. Otherwise, for most part, the law 
governing such Pleas in this country followed the lines laid down at Common Law. But after the 1848 Code 
of Procedure in New York, the situation was affected by Statutory Changes. In Some States Pleas in 
Abatement were completely abolished, and defects formerly available on such a Plea were reached either by a 


Motion or by an Answer in the Nature of a Plea in Abatement.

ThE GENERAL NATURE OF PLEAS IN BAR 


215. If the Declaration is sufficient both in Substance and in Form, so that neither a Dilatory Plea nor a 
Demurrer will lie, the defendant must Plead in Bar, and his Pleading must be either: 
(D By Way of Traverse 


(ID By Way of Confession and Avoid- 
ance 

(II) By Way of Estoppel 
Methods of Pleading in Bar 

ASSUMING that the plaintiff has stated a good Cause of Action in his Declaration, and the defendant desires 
neither to avail himself of any of the Dilatory Pleas, nor to Dernur, he must interpose a Plea in Ear, which nay be 
any one of Three Forms of Plea: 
First, he may meet the plaintiffs alleged Cause of Action by Traversing or Denying some or all of the Material 
Allegations of 
Fact stated in the Declaration; this he might do by Pleading the General Issue, which generally denied all the 
Material Allegations in the plaintiff's alleged Cause of Action; he might plead a Common or Specific Traverse, 
which was a Denial of a Material Fact in the pleader’s own language; or he might plead a Special Traverse, 
which was an Indirect Denial of a Material Allegation; Second, he may meet the plaintiff’ s Declaration by 
admitting the Truth of the Facts stated therein, arid then alleging a new combination of Facts or Events, to 
which a Rule of Substantive Law attaches the consequence of Non-Liability; such a Plea, known as a Plea in 
Confession and Avoidance, might be either in Discharge or in Justification and Excuse; Third, the defendant, 
without either Admitting or Denying the Facts alleged, may set up New Facts which operate to prevent the 
plaintiff from sustaining the Allegations 
Sec. 216 


Page 457 of 735 


PLEAS—PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 
435 
contained in the plaintiff's Declaration. Thus, to summarize, the defendant may meet an Alleged Cause in a 
Declaration by Pleading One of Three Forms of Traverse; by Pleading in Confession and Avoidance in Justification, 
in Excuse, or in Discharge; or by Pleading by Way of Estoppel. 


Special Pleas—The Different Varieties 

PLEAS other than General Issues are ordinarily distinguished from them by the name of Special Pleas; and when 
resort is had to these a Party is said to Plead Specially, as contrasted with Pleading the General Issue. The Issues 
produced upon Special Pleas, as being usually more specific and particular than those of Not Guilty, etc., are 
sometimes described as Special Issues, as contrasted with what were called General Issues; the latter term having 
been afterward applied, not only to the Issues, but to the Pleas which tendered and produced them. Thus, instead of 
Pleading the General Issue, the defendant, in certain cases, may effectually answer the Declaration by interposing a 
Special Plea which creates a Specific Issue. Such an Issue was raised by a Common or Specific Traverse denying 
some one Material Allegation in the Declaration upon which the Right of Action depends. Many Special Pleas in 
Bar, however, Admit the Truth of the Plaintiff's Allegations, but allege New or Affirmative Matter in avoidance of 
their legal operation.. One type of Special Flea, alleging Matter of Estoppel, neither con fesses nor denies the truth of 
the Declaration, though like other Pleas in Bar, It sets up Matter which defeats the Right of Action. Recoupment and 
Set-Off assert cross-de?nands due from the plaintiff to the defendant. 


It Is generally improper to set up a Defense by a Special Plea which can be shown under the General Issua But in 
many eases the defendant may be at liberty to show spedaily to the Court matters of defense, not 
merely consisting in a denial, but introductory of new matter, such as coverture or infancy. Although these may be 
admissible under the General Issue, yet being matter of justification or excuse, it is convenient to set forth the 
particular facts relied on as a defense in a Special Plea, which will apprise the Court and the adverse party of the cir- 
cumstances and nature of the defense, and keep the Facts and the Law distinct. 


Pleas which set up no new affirmative matter, but which merely set up evidential facts inconsistent with the 
plaintiff’s prima facie case, are said to be argumentative denials and improper. But there is a peculiar species 
of plea, known as a Special Traverse, which is an exception to the rule. 


THE VARIOUS FORMS OF TRAVERSE OR DENIAL 
216. The different Forms of Traverse or Denial may be classified as: 


(I) The Specific or Common Traverse (Il) The Special Traverse 
(III) The General Traverse, including 
(A) The General Issue 
(B) The Replication De Injuria 
A Traverse concludes with a Tender of Issue. 


AS previously pointed out, Pleas are of Two General Classes, viz., Dilatory Pleas; and Peremptory Pleas, or 
Pleas in Bar. Pleas in Bar are said to be either in Denial, that is, by Way of Traverse—or by Way of Confession 
and Avoidance of the Action—or by Way of Estoppel. It will be seen, however, that under the General Issue, 
Defenses may sometimes be raised of the sort raised by a Plea in Confession and Avoidance, as well as those 
raised by a Traverse. And of Traverses there are four sorts: First, the Specific or Common Traverse; Second, 
the Special Traverse; Third, the General Traverse, which includes the General Issue and the Replication Dc 
Injuria. The latter form of the General Traverse will be discussed in the next Chapter, 

Where an Ailegation is Traversed or Denied, it is evident that a question is at once raised between the Parties; 
and it is a Question of Fact, namely, whether the facts in the Declaration or other Pleading, as the case may be, 
which the Traverse denies, are true. A question being thus raised, or in other words, the Parties having arrived at a 
specific point, where matter was affirmed on one side and denied on the other, the party interposing the Traverse is 
generally obliged to offer or refer this question to some Mode of Trial, or as it is said, to Tender Issue. This he does 
by annexing to the Traverse an appropriate formula, as for instance: “And of this he puts himself upon the 


Page 458 of 735 


country,” thus proposing a Trial by the country—that is, by a Jury. If the Tender of Issue be accepted by the other 
Party, the Parties were at issue on a Question of Fact, and the question itself was called the “Issue.” A Tender of an 
Issue of Fact was and is accepted by what is called a “Joinder in Issue,” or “Similiter,” which consisted of a Form 
which read thus: “And the said A, as to the Plea of the said B, above Pleaded, and whereof he has put himself upon 
the country, doth the like.” 


As we have seen, the Tender of an Issue in Law, by Demurrer, is necessarily accepted by the other Party, but this 
is not true of the Tender of an Issue in Fact. An Issue of Fact need not necessarily be accepted, for the other Party 
may consider the Traverse itself as insufficient in Law. A Traverse, for instance, may, in denying a part only of the 
Declaration, be so framed as to involve a part that is immaterial or insufficient to decide the action, or the Traverse 
may be deemed defective in Point of Form, and the other party may object to its Sufficiency in Law on that 
ground. He, therefore, has a right to Demur to the Traverse as Insufficient in Law, instead of joining in the Issue 
Tendered. 

Ch. 22 


With this general statement in mind, the general rules relating to the Traverse may be considered, and then 
various Forms of Traverse may be considered in order. 


THE GENERAL REQUISITES OF TRAVERSE 


217. The following General Rules apply to the Traverse, without regard to whether, in Form, it is Common, 
General, or Special: 

(I) The Traverse should generally deny the Opposing Allegation in the Manner and Form in which it is 
made (modo et forma; i. e. 9xt Manner and Form as alleged”); thus putting the opposite Party to Proof 
in Manner and Form, as well as in general effect. 

(ID A Traverse may be taken upon a Mixed Allegation of Law and Fact, but not upon Matter of Law alone, nor 
upon matter not alleged. Upon Matter of Fact it must be where the Fact iseither Expressly Alleged, or 
Necessarily Implied from what is alleged. 


(IID The Traverse must not involve an Estoppel against the Party Pleading it. 


THE different kinds or Forms of Traverse having been previously explained, we shall here take up certain Rules 
as to the Manner of Pleading Denials. 


Form of Denial 

IT is customary in a Traverse to deny the Allegation in the Manner and Form in which it is made, and therefore to 
put the opposite party to prove it to be true in Manner and Form, as well as in general effect. Accordingly, he is 
often exposed at the Trial to the danger of a Variance by a slight deviation in his evidence from his Allegation. This 
doctrine of Variance, says Stephen, is founded on the strict quality of the Traverse here stated.’ This strictness is 
so far modified

PLEAS—PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 

Sec. 217 


that it is, in general, sufficient to prove accurately the substance of the Allegation, and a deviation in point of mere 
Form or in Matter quite Immaterial will be disregarded. The general principle is that the Traverse brings the fact into 
question, according to the Manner and Form in which it is alleged, and that the opposite Party must consequently 
prove that, in Substance at least, the Allegation is accurately true. The existence of this principle is indicated by 
the wording of a Traverse, which, when in the negative, generally denies the last pleading mode et forma [in 
Manner and Form as alleged]. This will be found to be the case in almost all Traverses, except the General Issue 
Non Fist Factum, and the Replication d€ injuria. These words, however, though usual, are said to be in no case 
strictly essential, so as to render their omission cause of Demurrer.” 


Page 459 of 735 


It is naturally a consequence of the principle here mentioned that great accuracy and precision in adapting the Allegation 
to the true state of the Fact are observed in all well-drawn Pleadings; the vigilance of the pleader being always directed to 
these qualities, in order to prevent any risk of Variance or Failure of Proof at the Trial in the event of a Traverse by 
the Opposite Party. 


Traverse Not to be Taken on Matter of Law Alone. 
AGAIN, in respect to all Traverses, it is laid down as a Rule that a Traverse must not be taken upon Matter 
of Law? A Denial of

the Law involved in the precedent Pleading 

is, in other words, an exception to the sufficiency of that Pleading in Point of Law, and is therefore within the scope 
and proper province of a Demurrer, and not of a Traverse. Thus, where, to an Action of Trespass for fishing in 
plaintiff s fishery, the defendant Pleaded that the locus in quo was an arm of the sea, in which every subject of the 
realm had the liberty and privilege of free fishing, and the plaintiff, in his Replication, Traversed that in the said arm of 
the sea every subject of the realm had the liberty and privilege of free nshing, this was he]d to be a Traverse of a 
mere Inference of Law-, and therefore bad.’ Upon the same principle, if a Matter be Alleged in Pleading, “by reason 
whereof” [virtute cujus] a certain legal inference is drawn, as that the plaintiff “became seised,” etc, or the 
defendant “became liable,” etc., this vit’tute cujus is not Traversable, because, if it be intended to question the 
Facts from which the seisin or liability is deduced, the Traverse should be applied to the Facts, and to those Cnly; 
and, if the legal inference be doubted, the course is to Demur. 


Traverse May be Taken on Allegation of Law and Fact 
BUT, on the other hand, where an Allegation is Mixed of Law and Fact, it may be Traversed.6 For example, in

Allegation that a man was “taken out of prison by virtue of a certain Writ of Habeas Corpus,” it may be Traversed 

that he was “taken out of prison by virtue of that Writ.”’ So, where it was alleged in a Plea that, in consequence of 


Page 460 of 735 


certain circumstances therein set forth, it belonged to the wardens and commonalty of a certain body corporate to 
present to a certain church, being vacant, in their turn, being the second turn, and this was answered by a Special 
Traverse, without this, that it belonged to the said wardens and commonalty to present to the said church, at the 
second turn, when the same became vacant, etc., in Manner and Form as alleged, the Court held the Traverse 
good, as not applying to a mere Matter of Law, but to “Matters of Law, or rather Matter of Right (as is this) 
resulting from Facts.” So, it is held, upon the same principle, that Traverse may be taken upon an Allegation that a 
certain person obtained a church by simony.° 


Traverse Not to be Taken on Matter Not Alleged 

IT is also a Rule that a Traverse must not be taken upon Matter not alleged.’ The meaning of this Rule will be 
sufficiently explained by the following cases: A woman brought an Action of Debt on a deed, by which the 
defendant obliged himself to pay her / 200 on demand if he did not take her to wife, and Alleged in her Declaration 
that, though she had tendered herself to marry the

defendant he refused, and married another woman. The defendant Pleaded that, after making the deed, he offered 
himself to marry the plaintiff, and she refused; absque hoc, “that he refused to take her for his wile before she had 
refused to take him for her husband.” The Court was of opinion that this Traverse was bad, because there had been 
no Allegation in the Declaration, “that the defendant had refused before the plaintiff had refused,” and therefore the 
Traverse went to deny what the plainff had not affirmed.” The Plea in this case ought to have been in Confession 
and Avoidance; stating merely the Affirmative Matter, that before the plaintiff offered the defendant offered, and 
that the plaintiff had refused him, and omitting the abs que hoc. Again, in an Action of Debt on Bond against 
the defendant, as Executrix of J. S., she Pleaded in Abatement that J. S. died intestate, and that Administration was 
granted to her. On Demurrer it was objected that she should have gone on to Traverse “that she meddled as Execu- 
trix before the Administration granted,” because, if she so meddled, she was properly charged as Executrix, 
notwithstanding the subscquent grant of Letters of Administration. But the Court held the Plea good in that respect; 
and I-Jolt, C. J., said “that, if the defendant had taken such Traverse, it had made her Plea vicious, for it is enough 
for her to show that the plaintiff's Writ ought to Abate, which she has done, in showing that she is chargeable 
only by another name. Then as to the Traverse, that she did not Administer as Executrix before the Letters of 
Administration were granted, it would be to Traverse what is not Alleged in the plaintiff’s Declaration, which would 
be against a Rule of Law, that a man shall never Traverse that which the plaintiff has riot Alleged in his Declaration.”

There is, however, the following Exception to this Rule, viz.: That a Traverse may be taken upon Matter 
which, though not Expressly Alleged, is Necessarily Implied.’~ Thus, in Replevin for taking cattle the defendant 
made Cognizance that A was seised of the close in question, and, by his command, the defendant took the cattle 
damage feasant. The plaintiff Pleaded in Bar that he himself was seised of one-third part, and put in his cattle abs 


Page 461 of 735 


que hoc, “that the said A was sole seised.” On Demurrer, it was objected that this Traverse was taken on Matter not Al- 
leged, the Allegation being that A was seised, not that .4 was sole seised. But the Court held that in the Allegation of 
Seisin that of Sole Seisin was Necessarily Implied, and that whatever is Necessarily Implied is Traversable, as 
much as if it were expressed. Judgment for plaintiff.” The Court, however, observed that in this case the plaintiff 
was not obliged to Traverse the Sole Seisin, and that the effect of merely Traversing the seisin Mocto et F’orma, 
as alleged, would have been the same on the Trial as that of Traversing the Sole Seisin. 


Traverse Involving Estoppcl 

A TRAVERSE must not involve an Estoppel against the Party using it. An illustration of this Rule appears in 
an Action on a Deed. A Party to a deed, who Traverses it, must plead Non Est Factum, and should not Plead that 
he did not grant, did not demise, etc.”” This Rule seems to depend on the Doctrine of Estoppel. A man is sometimes 
precluded, in Law, from Alleging or Denying a Fact in consequence of his own previous act, 


i~ Rex v. Kilderhy, I Wms.Saund. 311, 3124, n. 4, 85 Eng.Bep. 428, 433 (1669); Gllbert v. Parker, 2 Salk, 629, 91 Eng.Rep. 532 (1704); Meriton

allegation, or denial to the contrary, and this preclusion is called an “Estoppel.” It may arise either from Matter of 
Record, from the Deed of the Party, or from Matter in Pais; that is, Matter of Fact. 


It is from this Doctrine of Estoppel, apparently, that the Rule as to the mode of Traversing deeds has resulted, for 
though a Party against whom the deed is alleged may be allowed, consistently with the Doctrine of Estoppel, to say 
“Non Est Factum,” viz, that the deed is not his, he is, on the other hand, precluded by that doctrine from denying its 
effect or operation; because, if allowed to say “Non Concessft’ or “Non Demisit,” when the instrument purports to 
grant or to demise, he would be permitted to contradict his own deed. According]y, it will be found that in the case 
of a person not a Party, but a Stranger, to the deed, the Rule is reversed, and the Form of Traverse in that case is 
“Non Concessit,” etc.; 16 the reason of which seems to be that Estoppels do not hold with respect to strangers. 


MATERIALITY OF TUE TRAVERSE 


215. A Traverse must riot be taken on an Immaterial Allegation. This rule prohibits a Traverse; 
(I) On Matter that is Irrelevant or Insufficient in Law; 


(II) On Matter that is Prematurely alleged; 
(II) On Matter of Aggravation; 
(TV) On mere Matter of Inducement 


THIS rule prohibits a Pleader from Traversing on Matter that is either Irrelevant or Insufficient in Law.”

against a lessee for years, if the defendant Plead that before the rent was due he assigned the term to another, of 
which the plaintiff had notice, a Traverse of the notice would be bad, as producing an Immaterial Issue; for it is not 


Page 462 of 735 


mere notice of the assignment that discharges the lessee, but the lessor’s consent to the assignment, or his acceptance of rent 
from the assignee.”* So? in an Action of Debt on a Bond conditioned for the payment of 10 pounds 10 shillings at a 
certain day, if the defendant should Plead Payment of 10 pounds, a Traverse of such payment would be bad, for, if 
the whole sum of 10 pounds 10 shillings were not paid, the bond 

would be forfeited; and the payment of a less sum is wholly immaterial.”” The plaintiff in such case should Demur. 
So, where, to an Action of Trespass for Assault and Battery, the defendant Pleaded that a Judgment was recovered, 
and Execution issued thereupon against a third person, and that the plaintiff, to rescue that person’s goods from the 
Execution, assaulted the bailiffs, and that in aid of the Bailiffs, and by their command, the defendant mollitsr mantis 
imposuit upon the plaintiff, to prevent his rescue of the goods, it was holden that a Traverse of the Command of the 
Bailiffs was bad; for, even without their Command, the defendant might lawfully interfere to prevent a rescue, 
which is a breach of the peace.’° 


The Rule also prohibits a Pleader from Traversing on Matter which, though not Immaterial to the case, is 
prematurely alleged.”

Thus, If, in Debt on Bond, the plaintiff should declare that, at the time of sealing and delivery, the defendant was of 
Full Age, the defendant should not Traverse this, because it was not necessary to allege it in the Declaration; 
though, if in fact he was a minor, this would be a good subject for a Plea of Infancy, to which the plaintiff might 
then well reply the same matter, viz, that he was Of Age.” 


Again, this Rule prohibits the taking of a Traverse on Matter of Aggravation; that is, matter which only tends to 
increase the amount of Damages, and does not concern the Right of Action itself. Thus, in Trespass for Chasing 
Sheep, per quod the sheep died, the dyIng of the sheep, being Aggravation only, is not Traversable.”* 


And where Matter of Inducement is sb leged, which is not essential to the substance of the case, but only 
explanatory of the main Allegations, a Denial would be unriecessary.~ It is otherwise, however, when such matter is 
not merely explanatory. If essential, though in the Nature of Inducement, it may still be Traversed.””

Judgment. The plaintiff replied that the Judgment was satisfied, but kept on foot by fraud sari covin. The defendants traversed that the 
Judgment was satisfied, and this was considered a bad traverse, because to allege that it was satisfied was only Inducement to the 
Allegation that it was kept on foot by fraud and covin. This was the main point, and this should have been the subject of the traverse.

219. Where there are Several Allegations, all of which are Material, the Party may Traverse any one he pleases. 


THE Principle of this Rule is that where the case of any Party rests upon Several Allegations, each of which is 
essential to its support, it may be as effectually destroyed by controverting one part as another.” Thus, in an Action 
of Trespass, if the defendant Pleads that A was seised, and demised to him, a Traverse of either the Seisin or the 
Demise would be sufficient; as in either case, if maintained, it would be effectual to overcome the Defense.”! Again, 
in Trespass, if the defendant Pleads that A was Seized, and enfeoffed B, who enfeoffed C, who enfeoffed D, whose 
estate the defendant bath, the plaintiff may Traverse whichever of the feoffments he pleases.** Great care is 
necessary, however, in the selection of the Allegation to be thus denied, so as to oppose the one most open to 
objection; for, as we see in another place, those not expressly denied are taken as admitted.”° 


lie was sworn before the Lord Mayor, and that the defendant said be was falsely sworn in that Oath, it was held that the plaintiff’ s being sworn

DENIAL OF THE ESSENTIALS ONLY 


220. A Traverse must not be Too Large, nor, on the other hand, too Narrow. 
Qualification—A Material Allegation of Title or Estate may be Traversed as Alleged, though stated with 
unnecessary particularity. 


AS a Traverse must not be taken on an Immaterial Allegation, so, when applied to an Allegation that is Material, 
it should take in no more and no less of that Allegation than is necessary to raise a Material Issue. If it involves more 
than some essential proposition of operative fact, it is said to be too large; if less, too narrow. 


Traverse Too Large 

IN the first place, it must not be too large.m It may thus be too large by involving in the Issue circumstances of 
time, place, quantity, etc., which are Immaterial to the Merits of the particular case, though forming part of the 
Allegation Traversed. Thus, in an Action of Debt on a Bond, conditioned for the payment of £1,550, the defendant 


Pleaded that part of the sum mentioned in the condition, to wit, £ 1,500, was won by gaming, con-o. Comyn, Digest,

It is a mistake to cover by denial, not only the Material Allegations necessary to support the plaintiff's Cause of Action, but also some

trary to the statute in such case made and provided, and that the bond was consequently void. The plaintiff Replied 
that the bond was given for a just debt, and Traversed that the £1,500 was won by gaming in Manner and Form 
as alleged. On Demurrer it was objected that the Replication was ill, because it made the precise sum parcel of the 
Issue, and tended to oblige the defendant to prove that the whole sum of £1,500 was won by gaming; whereas the 
statute avoids the bond if any part of the consideration be on that account. The Court was of opinion that there was 
No Color to maintain the Replication; for that the Material Part of the Plea was that part of the money for which the 
bond was given was won by gaming, and that the words, “to wit, £1,500” were only Form, of which the Replication 
ought not to have taken any notice.” So where the plaintiff Pleaded that the Queen, at a Manor Court, held on such a 
day by L S., her steward, and by copy of Court Roll, etc., granted certain land to the plaintiff's lessor, and the 
defendant Rejoined, Traversing that the Queen, at a Manor Court, held such a day by I. S., her steward, granted the 
land to the lessor, the Court held that the Traverse was ill, “for the Jury are thereby bound to find a copy on such a 
day, and by such a steward, which ought not to be.” The Traverse, it seems, ought to have been that the Queen did 
not grant in Manner and Form as allege&™” 


Again, a Traverse may be Too Large by being taken in the Conjunctive instead of the Disjunctive, where it is not 
Material that the Allegation Traversed should be proved Conjunctively. Thus, in an Action of Assumpsit the 
plaintiff declared on a policy of insurance, and averred “that the ship insured did not arrive in safety, but that 
the said ship, tackle, apparel, ordnance, munition, artillery, boat, 


3L Colborne v, Stoekdale, I Str. 493, 93 Eng.Rep. 655 (1721). 


U. Lane v. Alexander, Cro.Jac. 202, 79 Eng.Rep. 177 

and other furniture were sunk and destroyed in the said voyage.” The defendant Pleaded with a Traverse: “Without 
this, that the said ship, tackle, apparel, ordnance, munition, artillery, boat, and other furniture were sunk and destroyed in 
the voyage in Manner and Form as alleged.” Upon Demurrer this Traverse was adjudged to be bad, and it was held 
that the defendant ought to have Denied Disjunctively that the ship or tackle, etc., was sunk, or destroyed, 
because in this Action for Damages the plaintiff would he entitled to recover compensation for any part of that 
which was the subject of insurance and had been lost; whereas (it was said), if Issue had been taken in the 
Conjunctive Form in which the Plea was Pleaded, “and the defendant should prove that only a cable or anchor ar- 
rived in safety, he would be acquitted of the whole.” ~ 


Traverse Too Large—Qualification of Rule 

On the other hand, however, a Party may, in general, Traverse a Material Allegation of title or estate to the extent 
to which it is alleged, though it need not have been alleged to that extent; and such Traverse will not be considered 
as Too Large.” For example, in an Action of Replevin, the defendant Avowed the taking of the cattle as damage 
feasant, in the place in which, etc.; the same being the freehold of Sir F. L. To this the plaintiff Pleaded that he was 
seised in his denjesne

as of fee of B. close, adjoining to the place in which, etc.; that Sir F. L. was bound to repair the fence between B. 
close and the place in which, etc.; and that the cattle escaped through a defect of that fence. The defendant 
Traversed that the plaintiff was seised in his demesne as of fee of B. close, and on Demurrer the Court was of 
opinion that it was a Good Traverse; for, though a less estate than a seisin in fee would have been sufficient to 
sustain the plaintiff s case, yet as the plaintiff, who should best know what estate he had, had Pleaded a seisin in fee, 
his adversary was entitled to Traverse the Title so laid.” Again, in an Action of Trespass for trespasses committed 
in a close of pasture containing eight acres in the town of Tollard Royal, the defendant Pleaded that W., Earl of 
Salisbury, was seised in fee and of right of an ancient chase of deer called “Cranborn,” and that the said chase did 
extend itself as well in and through the said eight acres of pasture as in and through the said town of Toflard Royal, 
and Justified the trespasses as committed in using the said chase. The plaintiff Traversed that the said chase ex- 
tended itself as well to the eight acres as to the whole town; and, Issue being taken thereon, it was fried, and found 
for the plaintiff. It was then Moved, in Arrest of Judgment that this Issue and Verdict were faulty, “because if the 
chase did extend to the eight acres only, it was enough for the defendant, and therefore the Finding of the Jury, 
that it did not extend as well to the whole town as to the eight acres, did not conclude against the defendants right in 
the eight acres, which was only in question. But it was answered by the Court, that there was no fault in the Issue, 
much less in the Verdict (which was according to the Issue); but the fault was in the defendants Plea that now takes 
the exception, for he puts in his Plea more than he needed, scil., the whole town, which being 
to his own disadvantage, and to the advantage of the plaintiff there was no reason for him to Demur upon it, but 
rather to admit it as he did, and so to put it in Issue. And so Judgment was given for the plaintiff.” ss 


Traverse Too Narrow 

A TRAVERSE must not be Too Narrow)! Of a Traverse that is Too Narrow, the following is an example: In an 
Action of Assumpsit brought for a compensation for the plaintiff’ s service as a hired servant, the plaintiff alleged 
that he served from March 21, 1647, to November 1, 1664. The defendant Pleaded that the plaintiff continued in the 
service till December, 1658, and then voluntarily quitted the service, without this, that he served until November 1, 
1664. This was a Bad Traverse; for, as the plaintiff in this Action for Damages is entitled to compensation pro 
tanto for any period of service, it is obviously no answer to say that he did not serve the whole time alleged)’* So a 
Traverse may be Too Narrow by being applied to Part Only of an Allegation which the Law considers as in its 
nature indivisible and entire; such as that of a prescription or grant. Thus, in an Action of Trespass for Breaking and 
Entering the plaintiff’s close, called S.C., and digging stones therein, the defendant Pleaded that there are certain 
wastes lying open to one another—one the close called S.C., and the other cafled S.G.—.and so proceeded to 
prescribe for the liberty of digging stones in both doses, and Justified the trespasses under that prescription. The 
Replication traversed the prescriptive right in B.C. only, dropping E.G.; but the Court held that the Traverse could

NEGATIVES AND AFFHIMATIVES PREGNANT“ 


221. These are Statements of Fact, either in a Negative or Affirmative Form, which carry within them or imply within 
them material contrary, Affirmative, or Negative Statements or Inferences in favor of the adverse party. Such a 
Statement renders the Pleading bad fiir Amhiguity. 


THE doctrine of Negatives and Affirmatives Pregnant appears most properly to arrange itself under the head of 
ambiguity or evasiveness. The principle underlying the Rule against a Negative Pregnant has n.t been always dearly 
and satisfactorily explained in the various treatises. This seems true even though the older cases reveal that the 
fault was a frequent ground of objection. Thus, as early as the year 1449, in the case which appeared in a Year 
Book,” in an action for negligently keeping a fire, by which plaintiff's houses were burned, the defendant Pleaded 
that the plaintiff s houses were not burned by the defendant’s negligence in keeping his fire; and it was objected 
that the Traverse was not good, as it had Two Intendxnents,—one, that the houses were not burned; the other, that 
they were burned, but

not by negligent keeping of the fire; and so it was a Negative Pregnant. The same ground, that is, that of ambiguity, 
vQas taken in a case in the early part of the Reign of Edward ZI (1307—1327) .-2 These two cases are believed to be 
the earliest authorities on the rule itself. And what is found in the later books on the subject tend to support the same 
view. 


A Negative Pregnant, therefore, may be defined as such a form of Negative Expression as may imply, or carry 
with it, an Affirmative, or to put the matter in another way, it is a Specific Denial which apparently Denies a 
Material Allegation, but which in fact leaves an Affirmative Allegation standing admitted, whereas an Affirmative 
Pregnant is an Affirmative Allegation implying a Negative.” To illustrate the Negative Pregnant, let us take two 
cases, one in which the issue is Immaterial and one in which the issue is Material. Suppose, in the first case, that 4 
alleges that B went out into the rain without an umbrella, and then B Specifically Traverses or Denies that he went 
out into the rain without an umbrella. Has he denied that he went out into the rain? He has not. In

“Such a denial is one pregnant with the admission of the Substantial Fact which is apparently controverted; or In other words, one which, 
although in the Form of a Traverse, really admits the important fact contained In the Allegation 

“Denials In the Forut of a Negative Pregnant arise (1) when the Allegation is of a Single Fact, with some qualifying or modifying 
circumstances, and the Traverse is in ipsis verbis, using exactly the same-language, and no more; (2) when the Allegation is of 
several distinct and separate facts or occurrences connected by the copulative conjunction, and the-traverse Is in ipsis verbis of the 


same facts and oeeurreaces also connected by the same conjunction.” Curnow v Phoenix Ins. Co., 46 S-C. 70, 94,24 S.E. 74~ 77 
(1896). Thus, If the defendant Is charged with taking a horse and a mule, a denial that lie took the horse and the mule Is a Negative Pregnant;

this instance the Issue is ImmateriaL But suppose that A alleges that B struck him over the head with a hickory 
stick, and then that B Specifically Traverses or Denies that he struck A over the head with a hickory stick, Has B 
denied that he struck A? The answer is no, and in this case the defendant, by the Form of his Plea, has left 
Affirmatively Standing a Material Allegation, to wit, the striking.” 


Such a Mode of Pleading was deemed faulty under the Rule that such an Ambiguous Form of Expression must be 
strictly construed against the Pleader. Thus, in the early case of Myn v. Cole,~~ in Trespass for Entering A’s house, 
B, the defendant, Pleaded that the plaintiff’s daughter gave him a License to do so, and that he entered by that 
License. In the Replication A stated that he did not Enter by her License, This was considered as a Negative 
Pregnant. It will be observed that this Form of Traverse may imply, or carry within it, that a License was given, 
though the defendant, B, did not Enter by that License. It is, therefore, in the Language of Pleading, said to be 
Pregnant with that Admission, that is, that a License was given. At the same time, the License is not expressly 
admitted; and the effect, therefore, is to leave it in doubt whether the plaintiff means to Deny the License or to 
Deny that the defendant Entered by virtue of that License. It is this ambiguity which appears to constitute the fault.*° 


44- In Baker v. Balley, 16 Barb. 54 (1852), under the New York Code of 1848, the administrators of A’s 
estate alleged that B assaulted A on a certain day at a certain place, and that the assault caused the death of A. The answer, among 
other things, traversed or denied that .8 assaulted A, the decedent, on the day alleged. At the Trial, B offered evidence to prove 
that he never assaulted A at all. It was held that this Offer of Proof was inadmlssible under the Answer, as the Negative Pregnant 
admitted that the defendant made the assault alleged, but on a different day. 
45. Oro.Jac. 87, 79 Engtep. 75 (1605). 
46. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, a II, Of the Principal Rules of 

The following is another example: In Trespass for Assault and Battery, the defendant Justified, for that he, being 
master of a ship, commanded the plaintiff to do some service in the ship; which he refusing to do, the defendant 
Moderately Chastised him. . The plaintiff Traversed, with an Abs que Hoc, that the defendant Moderately 
Chastised him; and this Traverse was held to be a Negative Pregnant; for, while it apparently means to put in Issue 
only the question of Excess (Admitting, by Implication, the Chastisement) it does not necessarily and distinctly 
make that Admission; and is, therefore, Ambiguous in its Form.” If the plaintiff had Replied that the defendant 
Immoderately Chastised him, the objection would have been avoided; but the proper Form of Traverse would have 
been de injuria sua propi--la abs que aliqua tall cansa. This, by Traversing the whole “cause alleged,” would 
have distinctly put in Issue all the Facts in the Plea; and no Ambiguity or doubt as to the extent of the Denial 
would have arisen. 


This Rule against a Negative Pregnant, it is said by Stephen, appears in modern times, at least, to have received 
no very strict construction. For many cases have occurred in which upon various grounds of distinction from the 
General Rule, that Form of Expression has been held free from objection.

covenants was that the dePleading, § 5, 335 (3d Am. ed. by Tyler washington,

fendant, the lessee, would not deliver possession to any but the lessor, or such persons as should lawfully evict him, 
the defendant Pleaded, that he did not deliver the possession to any but such as lawfully evicted him. On Demurrer 
to this Plea, it was Objected that the same was ill, and a Negative Pregnant, and that he ought to have said that such 
a one lawfully evicted him, to whom lie delivered the possession, or that he did not deliver the possession to any; but 
the Court held the Plea, as pursuing the words of the covenant, good, being in the Negative, and that the plaintiff 
ought to have Replied, and Assigned a Breach; and therefore Judgment was given against him.” 


A Denial that a person “carelessly and negligently did an act” is not a Denial that he did the act, and a Denial that 
a person “negligently” failed to look out for danger, is not a Denial that he actually failed to do so. 


“Material Facts alleged Conjunctively must be Denied Disjunctively.” ~ The denial must not be in a Form that 
raises an Issue of the literal truth of the Entire Allegation, without indicating whether it is claimed to be entirely or 
only partially false. 


THE SPECIFIC OR COMMON TRAVERSE 


222. The Specific or Common Traverse is an 
Express Denial of a Particular Allegation in 
the Opposing Pleading in the Terms of the 
Allegation, accompanied by a Tender of Issue 
Qt Formal Offer of the point Denied for Trial. OF the various kinds of Traverses, Specific, Special or General, the 
most ordinary and the most natural and primitive Travers~ is the so-called “Common or Specific Traverse.” It 
consists of a Tender of Issue;

See, also, Comment: Rule of Negative Pregnant in Pleading Applies only to Averment of Material Pacts, 83 Cent.L,J. 143 (1910), 

that is, of a Denial, accompanied by a Formal Offer of the point Denied for decision; and the Denial which it 
makes is in the Pleader’s Own Language and is by way of express contradiction in Terms of the Allegation 
Traversed—a point of considerable importance when we come to point out the danger of using the Specific 
Traverse. Such a Traverse or Denial, which for this purpose are Synonymous terms, controverts a Single Specific 
and Material Allegation of the Pleading to which it is interposed.~° 


The Function of a Specific Traverse 

ITS use in a Plea is thus to Deny any Single One of the Allegations of the Declaration, the failure to prove 
which would destroy the plaintiff s case, and where such Allegation would not be controverted by the General Issue 
in the particular action. 


Thus, in an Action of Covenant on a lease for not repairing windows, a Specific or Common Traverse, would 
read as follows: 

“And the said B, the defendant, by X, his Attorney, comes and defends the wrong and injury when, etc., and 
says that the said A ought not to have or maintain his aforesaid action against him, the said B, because he says that 
the windows of the said messuage or tenement were not in any part thereof ruinous, in decay, or out of repair, in 
the Manner and Form as the said A hath above complained against him, the said B. And of this he puts himself upon 
the country.” 


It will be noticed that this Traverse is expressed in the Negative. This, however, is not invariably the case with a 
Specific or Common Traverse; for if it be opposed to a precedent Negative Allegation, it will, of course, be in the 
Affirmative. Thus, where 


So. But see statement by Martin: ~The Plea must consist In the denial or traverse of one or more facts contained in the Declaration, without 
which the plaintiff would have no Cause of Action.” Civil Prooedure at Common Law, e. XI, Defences in Bar by way of Traverse, Article 1, §

in Special Assumpsit, the defendant Pleads the Statute of Limitations, saying in his Plea “that he, the said B, did not, 
at any time within six years next before the Commencement of this Suit, Undertake or Promise in the Manner and 
Form as the said A hath above complained,” etc., the plaintiff s Replication Traversing the Plea would be in the 
Affirmative, thus: “And the said A says that, by reason of anything in said Plea alleged, he ought not to be barred 
from having and maintaining his aforesaid action against the said B, because he says that the said B did, within six 
years next before the Commencement of this Suit, Undertake and Promise,” etc. 


The Danger of Using the Specific Traverse 


IN Pleading a Specific or Common Traverse, the Pleader was in grave danger of running into either an 
Argumentative Denial or a Negative Pregnant. 


First, as to the Argumentative Denial: 

An example is found in the famous case of Gibbons v. Pepper, >! where the plaintiff brought Trespass for Assault 
and Battery, to which the defendant Pleaded that he rode his horse upon the highway, his horse became frightened 
and ran away with him, and he couldn’t stop it; that he called to plaintiff to take care, the plaintiff did not get out 
of the way, and the horse ran over plaintiff against the will of the defendant. The plaintiff demurred to this Plea, and 
the Court gave judgment for plaintiff. It may not be considered a proper Plea in Confession and Avoidance, as it did 
not confess a trespass by defendant and then justify it, but rather alleged, hi effect, that the wrong was committed by 
the horse. Thus, it could be considered an Argumentative Plea, as there are two affirmatives, the Allegation by the 
plaintiff of an act done by defendant, and defends. ~ Ld.Itaym. 38, 91 Eng.1tep. 922 (1695). 

ant’s Plea that this Act was done by the horse. And, the General Rule is that Two Affirmatives do not make a good 
Negative. 


Second, as to the Negative Pregnant: A Negative Pregnant is a Plea which apparently traverses a Material 
Allegation in the Opponent’s Pleading, but which Affirmatively leaves a Material Allegation standing Admitted, 
under the theory that whatever is not Denied at the next Succeeding Stage of Pleading stands Admitted. Two 
examples, previously mentioned, will illustrate the point. A alleges that B went out into the rain without an 
umbrella. B specifically traverses or denies that he went out into the rain without an umbrella. Has he denied that he 
went out into the rain? Certainly not. But in this instance the Issue is Immateriai. Now, take a case where the Denial 
is material. A alleges that B struck him over the head with a hickory stick. B specifically Traverses or Denies that he 
struck A over the head With a hickory stick. Has he Denied the striking? Certainly not, and this time the Admitted 
Fact is Material, as that is the Fact which counts in an Action of Trespass for Assault and Battery. Thus, the danger 
of a defendant running into either an Argumentative Denial or a Negative Pregnant, had a tendency to discourage 
the use of the Specific Traverse—a procedure which it has been the aim of Modern Pleading to 

restore. 
TILE SPECIAL TRAVERSE 

223. The design of a Special Traverse, as distinguished from a Specific or Common Traverse, and the General Issue, is to 
explain or set forth the Grounds of the Denial. The matter set up in the Inducement must be such as amounts to a sufficient 
answer to the Declaration. The essential parts are: 


(a) The Inducement. 


(b) The Denial. 


Kottler & Peppy Com.taw PTdg. HB.—16 
448 
DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Ch. 22 
(c) The Verification. 

(I) The Inducement in a Special Traverse is that Part which consists of an Affirmative Statement, 
Introductory to or Explanatory of the Denial; in itself it is an Argumentative or Indirect Denial; it 
must in itself amount to a sufficient Answer in Substance to the Opposing Pleading; and it must not consist 
of a Direct Denial, nor be in the Nature of a Confession and Avoidance. 


Page 470 of 735 


The sufficiency of the Affirmation stated by way of Inducement to constitute a Defense may be tested by Demurrer. 


The Inducement cannot be Traversed unless the denial under the “Absque hoc” clause is bad, for it is a Rule 
that there can be no Traverse upon a Traverse, unless the first one is bad; nor, subject to the same Exception, 
can it be answered in Confession and Avoidance. 

(ID The Denial in a Special Traverse is in the Direct Form pursuing the words of the Allegation 
Traversed; its Form is by the use of the words “Absque Roe” (without this), that, etc. 
(III) The Special Traverse does not Tender Issue, but concludes with a Verification, thus: “And this the 
said 
is ready to Verify.” 
(IV) Where a Special Traverse is sufficient, the Other Party must Tender Issue, t be accepted by the 
Patty Traversing. 


The Essential Requisites of the Special Traverse 
THE Special Traverse had to satisfy Three Requirements as to Form; it consisted of: 


First, an Inducement containing an Affrrnative Statement of New Matter, which constituted an Indirect Denial of 
some Material Allegation in the Pleading to which it was interposed; 


Second, the Absque Hoc clause, constituting a Direct Denial of the Same Material Allegation and in the 
Same Language in which ft is made; and 

Third, the Conclusion in which the Party Pleading stated that he was ready to establish the truth of the 
matters set forth in his Plea, and which went by the name of Averment or Verification. 


The foregoing requisites were essential in order for a Special Traverse to be Good as to Form. It was also 
required that the Indirect Denial contained in the Affirmative Statement by Way of Inducement and the Direct 
Denial in the Abs que Hoc Clause, should relate to the same matter in the Adverse Pleading, according to 
Gould.” It may be observed that it was only a logical conclusion, from the very nature of a Special Traverse, that 
the Direct Denial of the Abs que Hoc Clause was always a Negative Averment, which necessarily required the 
Party Pleading to it to do so by repeating his Affirmative Averment and Tendering Issue therein.” 


Distinguished from the Specific Traverse— Effect 

ThE Traverse known more commonly as the Special Traverse differs from the Specific or Common Traverse, 
in that it is a Denial, preceded by Introductory Affirmative Matter, of Material Opposing Allegations; and, unlike the 
other Forms of Traverse, it does not Tender Issue, but Concludes with a Verification.”

defendant were desirous of raising a Question of Law, and referring it to the Court rather than to the Jury, he was 
allowed, by this curious hybrid Plea known as the Special Traverse, to make an Argumentative Denial. The 


Page 471 of 735 


Inducement to the Traverse discloses the real nature of the Party’s Case and shows the Grounds upon which the 
Denial proceeds. The Plea Concludes with a Direct Denial under the Abs que I 1cc Clause and an offer to Verify. 


(D The EpeciaZ Traverse—Normal Form. 

—An illustration of how such a Traverse, in its Normal Form, operates will help to make the matter clear. Let us 
assume that A, the heir of a lessor, L, brought an Action of Debt against B, the lessee, on a covenant to pay rent, the 
Declaration alleging that the plaintiff's ancestor, L, was seised in fee of the land; that L demised the land to the 
defendant B, for a certain term of years; that the defendant, B, covenanted to pay a certain rent; that L, the ancestor 
of the plaintiff died, that the reversion descended to A, the plaintiff; and that the rent became due from B, the 
defendant, to A, the plaintiff. 


Suppose that B, the defendant, opposes the alleged liability, as set forth in the Declaration, by saying “that, after 
the making of the said indenture, the said reversion of the said premises did not belong to the said L, the plaintiff A's 
ancestor, and his heirs in the Manner and Form as the said A hath in his said Declaration alleged. And of this the 
said B puts himself upon the country.” This is a Specific or Common Traverse. 


Suppose, however, that instead of using a Specific Traverse, the defendant B pleads that the plaintiff, A, ought 
not to maintain his action “because he says that L, the plaintiff’s ancestor, now deceased, at the time of the 
making of the said indenture, was seized in his demesne as of a freehold, for the term of his natural life, of and In 
the said demised 
premises, and continued so seized thereof until and at the time of his death; and that, after the making of the said 
indenture, and before the expiration of the said term, to wit, 
onthe dayof AD. 
at aforesaid, the said L died; where 
upon the term created by the said indenture wholly ceased and determined; Without this, that after the making of the 
said indenture, the reversion of the said demised premises belonging to the said L and his heirs in the Manner and 
Form as the said A hath in his said Declaration alleged. And this the said B is ready to verify. Wherefore he Prays 
Judgment if the said A ought to have or maintain his aforesaid action against him.” 


e The Substance of this Plea is that the plain~ tiff's ancestor, L, was seized for life only, and therefore that the term 
terminated at his death, which involves a Denial of the Allegation in the Declaration that the reversion belonged to 
the father in fee. The defendant’s course was therefore to Traverse the Declaration. Instead of doing so in the 
Common Form (by using the Specific or Common Traverse), he has adopted the Special Form (the Special 
Traverse), first setting out the New Affirmative Matter, that the plaintiff s ancestor, L, was seized for life, etc., and 
then annexing to this the Denial that the reversion belonged to him and his heirs by that peculiar formula: 
“Without this, that,” etc. 


The Special Traverse does not, like the Specific or Common Traverse, Tender Issue, but Concluded, prior to the 
Hilary Rules in 1834, with the words: “And this the said B is ready to Verify, wherefore he Prays Judgment,” etc., 
which is called a “Verification” and “Prayer of Judgment,” and is the constant Conclusion of all Pleadings in 
which Issue is not Tendered.” The Affirmative 


65. There never was, apparently, any good reason for concluding this Plea with a verification, thus postponing the tender of the 
Issue. By the Hilary Rules In 1834, such a Plea was required to conclude to the country; that is, to tender Issue. Martin, Civil Procedure 
at Common Law, c. XI, Defences in Bar by

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Ch 22 
Part of the Traverse—that is, the part which sets forth the New Matter—is called its “Inducement”; the Negative 
Part is called the “Absque Hoc Clause”; those being the Latin words formerly used, and from which the modern 
expression, “without this,” is translated.” These different parts and properties are all essential to a Special Traverse, 
which must always thus consist of an Inducement, a Denial, and a Verification; that is, prior to the Hilary Rules. 


The Regular Method of Pleading in answer to a Special Traverse was to Tender Issue upon it, with a repetition 


Page 472 of 735 


of the Allegation Traversed. Thus, to the Plea heretofore given by way of illustration, the Replication would read: 


“And, as to the said Plea by the said B above Pleaded, the said A. says that by reason of anything therein alleged 
he ought not to be barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action against the said B, because the said A 
says that after the making of the said indenture the reversion of the said demised premises belonged to the said L 
and his heirs, in the Manner and Form as the said A hath in his said Declaration above alleged. And this he 
Prays may be inquired of by the country.” 


The effect, therefore, of a Special Traverse, is, as in Replevin where the defendant Pleads an Avowry, to 
postpone the Issue to One Stage of the Pleading later than would be attained by a Specific or Common Traverse, for 
if the defendant should Deny in the Common Form without an Inducement, and Conclude to the Country, it would 
only remain 


Way of Traverse, § 286, Conclusion of Special Traverse, 243, 244 (St. Paul, 1905).

684 (1692). 
for the plaintiff to add the Similiter, and Issue would therefore be Joined, whereas, on a Special Traverse, the Issue 
is Not Tendered until the Next Pleading. 


(II) The Special Traverse—Abnormal Form,~—Once established as a recognized part of the Common Law System of 
Pleading, the Special Traverse grew in favor. As a result of this development it was adopted in cases where the 
original reasons for such a Form of Pleading were inapplicable, as in cases where the Inducement included No New 
Explanatory Matter, but consisted in a mere repetition of the Original Declaration.” Thus, for example, in cases of 
assault, where the defendant Justified his act under a Warrant of Arrest, the plaintiff was permitted to Reply that the 
defendant of his own wrong, made the assault, without this,—that he had any Warrant of Arrest to justify his act. 


Although this Form of the Special Traverse was Abnormal and a manifest departure from the General 
Requirements of a Special Traverse as defined by the leading authorities, it nevertheless received the approval of the 
Courts~ As, however, it was used only occasionally, it has in Modern Times been largely superseded by the Specific 
or Common Traverse.

of 
dollars, payable quarterly, at the four most usual feasts or days of payment of rent in 
the year; that is to say, on the 25th day of March, the 24th day of June, the 29th day of September, and the 25th 
day of December, in each and every year, in equal portions. And the said CM. did thereby, for himself, his

the said C.D., his executors, administrators, or assigns should and would well and truly pay, or cause to be paid to

The Use and Object of the Special Traverse 


OBSERVING that “it is remarkable 
.that no author should have hitherto offered any explanation of the objects for which it [the Special Traverse] 
was originally devised, and in a view to which it continues to be, in some cases, adopted,” 50 Stephen declares that 
the general design of a Special Traverse, as distinguished from a Specific or Common Traverse, is to explain or 
qualify the Denial, instead of putting it in the Direct Form; and there were several different factual situations, in 
reference to which the Ancient Pleaders seemed to have thought it necessary to adopt this Form of Pleading. 60 


(I) Where the Defendant is Estopped by Some Rule of Law from Making a Direct and Positive 
Denial,—In some factual situations as presented in a Declaration, a Direct Denial may be regarded as inappropriate 
by reason of its opposition to some General Rule of Law. Thus, in the example of a Special Traverse above 
discussed, it was improper to Traverse in the Specific or Common form, viz., “that after the making of the said in- 
denture the reversion of the said demised premises did not belong to the said L and his heirs,” &c., because, by a Rule 
of Law, a tenant is precluded, or in the Language of Pleading, Estopped from Alleging that his lessor, li, had no 
title in the premises demised; and a general assertion that the reversion did not belong to him and his heirs would 
appear to be prohibited by the same Rule. A tenant, however, is not by law

Estopped to say that his lessor had only a particular estate, which has since expired.°! 


In a case, therefore, in which the Declaration alleged a seisin in fee in /,, the lessor, and the nature of the 
Defense was that he had a particular estate only, namely, an estate for life, since expired, the Pleader would resort, 
as in the example, to a Special Traverse, setting forth the lessor’s limited title, by Way of Inducement, and Traversing 
his seisin of the reversion in fee under the Absque Hoc Clause By such a course the defendant is thus enabled to 
avoid an objection that might otherwise arise on the ground of Estoppel. 


(U) Where the Defendant Desires to Avoid an Issue of Pact as on a Specific or Common Traverse in 
Favor of Developing and Submitting Some Aspect of the Con. troversy to the Judgment of the Court as an 
Issue in Law.—In some factual situations it may be inexpedient to submit the Issue involved as an Issue of Fact as 
on a Specific Traverse; it may be more propitious to submit to the question involved to the Judgment of the Court 
as an Issue in law. There may be many reasons why it might be desirable that, without going to Trial, a litigant 
bring a question before the Court for determination in the first instance, and for that purpose an Issue of Law should 
be raised. In such a case, therefore, the Pleader would state the circumstances of the transaction in an In- 
ducement, substituting a Special for a Specific Traverse. The facts thus alleged by Way of Inducement are not 
subject to Traverse, but may be Demurred to as insufficient in Law to contradict the Declaration. This

operates to submit the case to the Court on the Law without the intervention of a Jury.°2

(UD The Abs que Hoc Clause and the Conclusion with a Veriftcation.—Although these reasons seem to 
show the purpose of the Inducement, they do not account for the Two Other Distinctive Features of the Special 
Traverse, viz., the .etbsque hoc Clause and the Conclusion with a Verification. For it will naturally suggest itself 
that the Affirmative Matter, in each of the above cases, might have been Pleaded per se, without the addition of the 
Absque Hoc Clause. So,. whether the Abs que Hoc were added or not,. the Pleading, consistently with any of the 
above reasons, might have Tendered Issue, like a Specific or Common Traverse, instead of Concluding with a 
Verification. 


These latter Forms were dictated by other principles. The Direct denial, under the Abs que Hoc Clause, was made 
necessary by this consideration: that the Affirmative Matter, taken alone, would constitute only an Indirect, or as it is 
called in Pleading, an Argumentative Denial of the precedent statement; and under the Rule that Pleadings must be 
Direct and not Argumentative, all Argumentative Pleading is prohibited. In order, therefore, to avoid the Defect in Form 
of Argumentativeness, the course adopted was to follow up the Explanatory, Affirmative Statement of Matter by 
Way of Inducement with a Direct Denial.” 


With respect to the Verification, this Conclusion was adopted in a Special Traverse, with a view to Another 
Rule, to the effect that wherever New Matter is introduced int~ a Pleading it is improper to Tender Issue, hence the 


Conclusion must consequently close with a Verification. The Inducement setting forth new matter makes a Verifica-

tion necessary, in conformity with that rule. 


The Thiles for Determining the Sufficiency of a Special Ti-averse 
THERE were, according to Martin ~ Three Well Established Rules for determining the sufficiency of a Special 
Traverse as heretofore defined and described. 


The first rule was that the Inducement 

in a Special Traverse must be such as in itself amounts to a sufficient Answer in Substance to the Last Pleading. As 
we have seen, it is the object of the Inducement to give an explained or qualified Denial; that is, to state such 
circumstances as tend to show that the Last Pleading is not true, the Abs que Hoc being added merely to put that 
Denial in a Positive Form, which previously had been made in an Indirect Form. Now, an Indirect Denial amounted, in 
Substance, to an Answer, without the aid of the Absque Hoc Clause, and despite the fact that it was Argumentative 
in Form. It follows, therefore, that an Inducement, when properly framed, must always in itself contain, without the aid 
of the Abs qua Hoc Clause, an Answer, in Substance to the Last Pleading.~ Thus, in our example above, the 
Allegation that L was seised for life, and

that estate is since determined, is in itself and in Substance, a Sufficient Answer, as Denying, by Implication, that 
the fee descended from L, the lessor, to A, the Plaintiff. 

The second Rule, which followed from the same consideration, as to the object and 
use of a Special Traverse, was that the Answer given by the Inducement could be of no other nature than that of 
an Indirect Denial; the Inducement was bad if it consisted of a Direct Denial.” Thus, the plaintiff being bound by 
Recognizance to pay one X £300 in six years, by £50 per annum, at a certain place, alleged that he was ready 
every day at that place to have paid to X one of the said installments of £50, but that X was not there to receive it. To 
this the defendant Pleaded that X was ready at the place to receive the £50, Abs que hoc, that the plaintiff was there 
ready to have paid it. The plaintiff Demurred on the ground that the Inducement alleging X to have been at the place 
ready to receive contained a Direct Denial of the plaintiff’s precedent allegation that X was not there, and should 
therefore have Concluded to the Country, without the Abs qua Hoc Clause, and Judgment was given accordingly for 
the plaintiff.” 


The third rule was that the answer given by the Inducement must not be in the Nature of a Plea in Confession and 
Avoidance.” Thus, if the defendant, B, makes title as the assignee of a term of years of X, and the plaintiff, A, in 
answer to this, claims under a prior assignment to himself from X of the same term, this is a Confession and 
Avoidance; for it admits the assignment to the

defendant, B, but seeks to avoid its effect, by showing the prior assignment. Therefore, if the plaintiff, A, Pleads 
such assignment to himself by Way of Inducement, adding, under an Absque Hoc, a Denial that X assigned to the 
defendant, this Special Traverse is bad. The plaintiff should Plead the assignment to himself as in Confession and 
Avoidance, without the Traverse. 


Still a fourth Rule may be added, which Martin «says was more distinctively a Rule of Practice, resulting from 
the Nature of an Inducement. The Rule was that with respect to Special Traverses, the Opposite Party has no right to 
Traverse an Inducement, or, as the Rule is more commonly expressed, there could be no Traverse upon a Traverses’ 
Thus, in the example given above, if the Replication, instead of reaffirming the matter denied in the Absque Hoc 
Clause, had Traversed the Inducement either in the Special or Common form, denying that L, the lessor, at the time of 
making the indenture, was seised in his demesne as of freehold for the term of his natural life, etc., such Replication 
would have been bad, as containing a Traverse upon a Traverse, The reason for the Rule is both Formal and 
Technical.” By the first Traverse a matter 
is denied by one of the parties which had been alleged by the other, and which, having

once alleged it, the latter is bound to maintain, instead of prolonging the Series of the Pleadings and retarding the 
Issue by resorting to a new Traverse. 


This Rule is, however, open to an important Exception, viz., that there may be a Traverse upon a Traverse when 
the first is a bad one, or, in other words, if the Denial under the Abs que Hoc of the first Traverse be Insufficient in 
Law, it may be passed by, and a new Traverse taken on the Inducement.” Thus, in an Action of Prohibition, the 
plaintiff declared he was elected and admitted as one of the Common Council of the City of London, but that the 
defendants delivered a Petition to the Court of Common Council, complaining of an undue election, and suggesting 
that they themselves were chosen; whereas (the plaintiff alleged) the Common Council had No Jurisdiction to 
examine the validity of such an election, but the same belonged to the Court of the Mayor and Aldermen. The 
defendants Pleaded that the Common Council, time out of mind, had authority to determine the election of Common 
Councilmen; and that the defendants being duly elected the plaintiff intruded himself into the office; whereupon the 
defendants delivered their Petition to the Common Council, complaining of an undue election; without this, that the 
Jurisdiction to examine the validity ofsuch election belonged to the Court of Mayor and Aldermen. The plaintiff 
Replied by Traversing the Inducement; that is, he Pleaded that the Common Council had not authority to determine 
the election of Common Councilmen, Concluding to the Country. To this the defendants Demurred, and the Court 
adjudged that the first Traverse was bad, because the question in this

Action of Prohibition was not whether the Court of Mayor and Aldermen had Jurisdiction, but whether the Common 
Council had; and that, the first Traverse being Immaterial, the second was well taken. 


As the Inducement cannot, when the Denial, under the Absque Hoc, is Sufficient in Law, be Traversed, so, for 
the same reasons, it cannot be answered by a Pleading in Confession and Avoidance. But, on the other hand, if 
the Denial be insufficient in Law, the Opposite Party has then a right to Plead in Confession and Avoidance of the 
Inducement, or (according to the nature of the case) to Traverse it; or he may Demur to the whole Traverse for the 
Insufficiency of the Denial. 


As the Inducement of a Special Traverse, when the Denial under the .ttbsque Hoc is sufficient, can neither 
be Traversed nor Confessed and Avoided, it follows that there is, in that case, no Manner of Pleading to the 
Inducement. The only way, therefore, of answering a good Special Traverse Is to Plead to the Abs que Hoc, which 
is done by Tendering Issue on such denial. But, though there can be no Pleading to an Inducement, when the Denial 
under the Abs que Hoc is sufficient, yet the Inducement may be open, in that case, to Exception in Point of Law. If 
it be faulty in any respect, as, for example, in not containing a Sufficient Answer in Substance, or in giving an 
Answer by Way of Direct Denial, or by way of Confession and Avoidance, the Opposite Party may Demur to the 
whole Traverse, though the Abs que Hoc be good, for this insufficiency in the Inducement. 


The Use of the Special Traverse at the Present Time 

HAVING explained the Form, the Effect, and the Use and Object of a Special Traverse, it remains to 
show in what cases this Method .01 Pleading is or ought to be applied at the present day. First, it is observed by 
Stephen, 
that this Form was at no period applicable to every case of Denial, at the pleasure of the Pleader. There are many 
cases of Denial to which the plea of Special Traverse has never been applied, and which have always been and 
still are the subjects of Traverse in the Common Form exclusively." These it is not easy to enumerate or define; they 
are determined by the course of precedent, and in that way become known to the practitioner. On the other 
hand, in many cases where the Special Traverse used anciently to occur, it is now no longer practiced. Even when 


Page 478 of 735 


the formula was most in repute, the use of this species does not appear to have been regarded as matter of necessity; 
and, in cases which admit or require no Allegation of New Matter, we find the Special and the Common Traverse 
to have been indifferently used by the Pleaders of those days. But in Modern Times the Special Traverse, without an 
Inducement of New Matter, has been considered, not only as unnecessary, but as frequently improper. As the taste in 
Pleading gradually simplified and improved, the prolix and dilatory effect of a Special Traverse brought it into 
disfavor with the Courts; and they began, not only to enforce the doctrine that the Common Form might 
allowably be substituted in cases where there was No Inducement of New Matter, but often intimated their 
preference of that Form to the other.” 


There is a tactical disadvantage to the Pleader, in the use of the Special Traverse, that the Inducement tends to 
open the real nature of the party’s case, by giving notice to his adversary of the precise grounds on which the Denial 
proceeds, and thus facilitates to the latter the preparation of his Proofs, or enables him to test the Grounds of 
Defense by Demurrer. And even though the case be

such as would admit of an Inducement of New Matter explanatory of the Denial, the usual course is to omit any 
such Inducement, and to make the Denial in an Absolute Form, with a Tender of Issue; thus substituting the 
Common for the Special Formula. The latter, however, appears to be still allowable when the case is such as admits 
of an Inducement of New Matter, except in certain instances to which, by the course of precedent, the Common 
Form of Traverse has always been exclusively applied. And, where allowable, it should still be occasionally 
adopted, in a view to the various grounds of necessity or convenience by which it was originally suggested. 


TUE GENERAL ISSUE—ITS 
NATURE AND USE 


224. The General issue is a Denial of the 
Legal Conclusion sought to be drawn from the Declaration. 


It Denies by a General Form of expression the defendant’s liability, and enables the defendant to contest, without 
Specific Averments of the Defense to be asserted, most of the Allegations which the plaintiff may be required to 
prove in order to sustain his action, and in some actions to raise also various Affirmative Defenses. It fails to perform 
the Functions of Pleading, either in giving Notice or in reducing the case to Specific Issues. 


The Nature and Use of the General Issue 

WHILE the Specific or Common Traverse is of frequent occurrence, there is another class of Traverse 
which, from its great importance and use, requires particular study. This form of Traverse is known as the 
General issue, under which, in most of the Modern Common-Law Actions, there is an appropriate Form of Plea 
fixed by Ancient Usage, as the proper method of Traversing the Declaration, where the defendant means to deny the 
defendant’s liability. This Form of Traverse appears to have been so called because the issue that it Tenders is of a 
more general and comprehensive character 
than that tendered by the Specific or Common Traverse. The General Issue, which is one of the two General 
Traverses, the Replication De Injuria 7 being the other, differs from the Specific or Common Traverse in that it 
Denies by a General Form of expression, such as “Not Guilty,” the defendant’s liability, instead of Denying some 
Specific Allegation of Fact on which his liability depends. Or, put in a slightly different way, it differs in two 
respects: 


First, in Point of Form, the General Issue Traverses, not by words of Direct Denial, but, as Professor 
Keigwin says, “by a fixed phrase of compendious negation”, such as Nil Debet in Debt or Non Assumpsit in 


Page 479 of 735 


Special or General Assumpsit; and 


Second, it generally operates to Deny and thus places in Issue, not a Single, Material Allegation, but all the 
Essential facts which constitute the plaintiff’ s cause of action,n 


As thus developed, the Scope and Effect of the Plea by way of the General Issue assumes great significance, as 
the Tender of Issue thus made on the Declaration operates to close the Pleadings, and to enable the defendant to 
escape from the earlier requirement that he must rest his Defense 
on a Single, Material Allegation, thereby, from the defendant’s point of view, facilitating the progress of the cause. 
It should be observed, however, that the General Issue was in Form a Specie of “Licensed Duplicity, in that by such 
a Plea the defendant, into flatu [at one breathil Denies all the Several Facts alleged in the Declaration.” ~ Thus, the 
General Issue provides a brief and convenient form of Plea in many actions, comprehensive in its nature, and under 
which the defendant is or was permitted to prove,

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
without Specific Allegation, almost All Matters in Denial of his liability, as alleged, or to contest in evidence All 
Allegations requiring Proof on the part of the plaintiff. 


-In Case, Eiectment, Trespass, in its Three Forms, and Trover, the Plea of the General Issue was, Not Guilty; in 
Replevin, Won Cepit; in Detinue, Non Detinet; in Debt upon a Simple Contract, Nil Debet; in Debt on a 
Specialty and in Covenant, it was Non efl Factum; and, in both Special and General Assumpsit, Non Assumpsit, 
or that the defendant made no such Promise. The effect of these General Issues varied with the different Forms of 
Action, as to what Defenses could be set up under them, and what must be raised by Specific Denials aimed at 
Particular Allegations, and what by Pleas in Confession and Avoidance. 


To confine the investigation to the points of actual disagreement, and relieve the plaintiff of the burden of 
proving what the defendant does not really dispute, it is provided in Code Pleading that the plaintiff may Verify his 
Complaint, and then the Denials of the Answer must be Specific, and must also be made under Oath. This 
requires the Denials to be truthfully made, and to put in Issue only the points on which the defendant means to 
rely. Thus, in a suit on a fire insurance policy, there may be rio dispute as to the execution of the contract sued on, 
but the company may expect to avoid liability by showing in Defense some excuse. Accordingly, if the Complaint 
be Verified, the company cannot Deny the signature or due execution of the policy, of which the Proof might be 
difficult for the plaintiff to obtain and produce. It is a great imposition to compel the plaintiff to produce, and the 
Court to hear, evidence in regard to what is not truly disputed. It is burdensome enough to have to establish rights in 
real controversies.’ At Common Law, while it is a prin 
ciple that Pleadings ought to be true, ye there were no means of enforcing the RulE Thus the Common-Law 
Pleadings often fail ed to reduce the case to the real Issues ii dispute. 


Report of the Common-Law Commissioners, ot which the Rules of HilT. 4 Wm. IV were founded by which the Scope of the 
General Issue was limit ed, it is said: “Special Pleading, considered in its principle, is a valuable forensic invention peculiar to the 
Common Law of England, by the effect of which the precise point in controversy between the parties is developed, and presented in a shape 
fit for decision. If that point is found to consist of matter of fact, the parties are thus apprised of the exact nature of the question to 
be decided by the Jury, and are enabled to prepare tl,eir proofs with proportionate precision. If, on the other hand, it turns out to 
be Matter of Law, they have the means of immediately obtaining the decision of the cause, without the expense and trouble of a Trial, by De- 
murrer; that is, by referring the legal question so evolved, to the determination of the Judge. But where, Instead of Special Pleading, the 
General Issue is used, and under it the defendant is allowed to bring forward matters in Confession and Avoidance, these benefits are 
lost. Consisting, as that Plea does, of a mere summary denial of the case stated by the plaintiff, and giving no notice of any defensive 
Allegation on which the defendant means to rely, it sends the whole ease on either side to Trial, without distinguishing the fact from 
the law, and without defining the exact question or questions of fact to be tried. It not unfrequently, therefore, happens that the parties 
arc taken by surprise, and find themselves opposed by some unexpected matter of defense or reply, which, from the want of timely notice, 
they are not In due condition to resist. But nfl effect of more common, a,id indeed almost invariable, occurrence is the unnecessary ac- 
cumulation of proof, and consequently of expense; for as nothing is admitted upon the Pleadings, each party is obliged to prepare 


Page 480 of 735 


himself, an far as it is practicable, with evidence upon nil the difFerent points which the Nature of the Action can by possibility make it 
Incumbent upon him to establish, though many of them may turn out to he undisputed, and many of them may be such as his adversary, if 
compelled to plead specially, would have thought it unfiesirable to dispute. It may even happen (and that Is not an unfreguent 
occurrence) that the controversy under this form of Plea turns entirely upon the Matter of Law, there being no fact really in dispute; 
and In that case the Mode of Decision by Jury is not only defective, but misplaced, and the Trial might have been spared altogether, if the 
parties bad proceeded by way of Special Pleading, and raised the guestlon upon Demurrer.”

Nothing could be more absurd than the irregular, variable, and arbitrary Scope of the General Issue in the 
Different Forms of Action. There is no rhyme or reason or policy in it; nothing but a bewilderment of historical 
eccentricities. The Function of Pleading is to ascertain with precision the Matters on which the Parties differ 
and the points on which they agree, and thus to arrive at Certain Clear-Cut Issues upon which the case has to be 
decided. The main Object of Pleadings is to produce such Issues, and thus to narrow the controversy to the real 
points which have to be contested and proved. The practical utility of Pleadings to accomplish this function or 
object has been grievously impaired by the unreasonable Scope and Latitude which are allowed to the General 
Issue in some actions. The apparent Singleness and Simplicity of the General Issue are entirely illusory. It fails to 
focus the controversy upon the real point. It frequently violates the Rule that a Party must either Plead by 
Way of Denial or in Confession and Avoidance. In Assumpsit, Case, Debt on Simple Contract, Ejectment, and 
Trover, the General Issue has an Exceedingly Broad Scope, which cannot be explained by any principle or 
process of reason. ing. What has to be Specially Pleaded is largely an accidental matter of arbitrary exceptions. so 


When the defendant Pleaded Affirmatively to justify or excuse the charge, it was necessary to set forth the 
Particular Facts of palliatidn and excuse by a Special Plea of Confession and Avoidance, which would ap- 
prise the Court and the Adverse Party of the nature and circumstances of the Defense; but, Special Pleading having 
become perverted into an obstacle to justice, the Courts, by relaxation of the strictness anciently observed, 
permitted the Scope of the General

459 


Issue to be extended, so as to leave almost every Defense open, and to allow many affirmative Defenses to be given 
in evidence at the Trial under the General Issue. 


Where a given Defense can be set up under the General Issue, it is improper to attempt to raise that Defense by a 
Specific Traverse. Where the General Issue can be used as a Denial, it must be used. The reason for, requiring the 
General Issue seems to have been to close the Pleadings at an early Stage. The Rule, however, does not prohibit a 
Party from Pleading Affirmatively New Matter which is Admissible under the General Issue, but only such as 
constitutes a mere Denial.” 


In view of the important character of this Plea in restricting the progress of the Pleadings and extending the 
privilege of the defendant in establishing his Defense in evidence, it seems proper here to explain in what cases it 
should be used. To do this, it is necessary to examine the Scope of the Different General Issues in each Particular 
Action, to ascertain what Defenses must or must not be Pleaded Specially. 


In One Action a given Defense may be Admissible under the General Issue, while in another the Same Defense 
would require a Specific Traverse or an Affirmative Plea.

PLEAS IN CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE 
—THE NATURE AND FORM 


225. If, histead of Denying in the Direct Form, the Party wishes to assert a Defense in Justification or 
Discharge of the Matter alleged, lie must Plead by Way of Confession and Avoidance. Pleading in Confession and 
Avoidance Admits the Truth of Opposing Allegations, and Avoids their Legal Effect by alleging Other Facts. 

Pleas in Confession and Avoidance are divided, with reference to their subject-matter, 

into 
(a) Pleas in Justification or Excuse. Such a Plea, while Admitting the Facts alleged by the plaintiff, shows in 
effect that he had not at any time a Good Cause of Action, either by reason of some legal right of the ,lefendant 
justifying his conduct in Point of Law, or some act or conduct of the plaintiff excusing him from liability in 
the particular case. 


(b) Pleas in Discharge. Such a Plea Admits that a Cause of Action once existed in the plaintiff, but shows that 
it has been Discharged by some Matter subsequent, either of Fact or of Law. 
Pleadings in Confession and Avoidance tie not Tender Issue, but Conclude with a Verification and Prayer of 
Judgment. 


In General 

A PLEADING in Confession and Avoidance, as the terms imply, does not, like the Traverse, deny the 
Allegations of Fact contained in the Opposing Pleading, but Confesses them, mid Avoids their Legal Effect. A Plea 
in Confession and Avoidance, for instance, Confesses the Truth of the Allegations in the Declaration, either 
expressly or by implication, and then proceeds to allege New Matter which deprives the Facts admitted of their 
Ordinary Legal Effect, and 

avoids them- Thus, in an Action of Trespass for Assault and Battery, a Plea Admitting Facts alleged to have 
been done by the defendant, but showing that they were done 
by the plaintiff, is a Plea in Ciinfession and Avoidance. 


Affirmative Pleas in Confession and Avoidance are either by Way of Justification and Excuse, showing that, even 
admitting plaintiff s prima fade case, he never had a Cause of Action, or by way of Discharge, showing that, 
although a Cause of Action once existed, yet it has been taken away by some Subsequent Matter. Pleas of Estoppel 
are another variety of Affirmative Pleas.” 


Pleas in Justification or Excuse 


A PLEA in Justification or Excuse shows that the plaintiff never had at any time a good Cause of Action, either by 
reason of some legal right of the defendant justifying his conduct in Point of Law, or some act or conduct of the 
plaintiff Excusing him (the defendant) from liability in the particular case. The Former is a Plea in Justification; the 
latter, a Plea in Excuse. This distinction is supported by authority, though Pleas of Both Classes are usually treated 
together, as being of the same general effect. Where the defendant, admitting the facts stated by the plaintiff to be 
true, alleges in contradiction the exercise of a right founded upon Matter of Title, Interest in or Respecting Land, 
Authority derived either Mediately or Immediately from the plaintiff, or the operation of some General Rule of Law 
applicable to the particular case, the Plea is one of Justification, the Defense being that the doing or omission of the 
acts complained of was Justified in Point of Law by the existence of such right. Here the facts must be fully set 
forth, as a Justification must be Specially Pleaded.ss But where, still Adsa, Dana v. Bryant, 1 Gil. (IIl.) 104 (1844).

mitting the plaintiff’s Allegations, the defendant Pleads, for instance, that his conduct was purely in Self-Defense, 
or that the performance by him of a contract obligation was prevented by the plaintiff, the Plea is one of Excuse, the 
plaintiff’ s conduct being relied on as his apology for doing or not doing the act in question; and here, again, the 
statement must be particular, the reason for all Special Pleadings being to fully apprise the adversary of what he 
is to be called upon to meet.” Pleas in Justification or Excuse generally include all Pleas in Confession and 
Avoidance which are not in Discharge of the defendant’s liability. The form of Plea in Justification and Excuse

Cli. 22 

Conclusion of Pleading 
A PLEADING in Confession and Avoidance does not Tender Issue, and, like all other Pleadings which do not 

Tender Issue, it Concludes with a Verification and Prayer of Judgment. 


GIVING COLOR 


226. A Plea in Confession and Avoidance must Give Color; that is, admit the apparent truth of the 
plaintiff’s Allegations and give him credit for an apparent or prima facie Right of Action, which the New Matter in 
the Plea destroys. Color may be Express or implied. 


Implied Color is the tacit admission of the plaintiff’s prima facie case by failure to deny 
it. 


Express Color is a Fictitious Allegation, not Traversable, to give an appearance of right to the plaintiff, and 
thus enable the defendant to Plead Specially his own Title, which would otherwise amount to the General Issue. It is a 
licensed evasion of the rule against Pleading Contradictory Matter Specially. 


Giving Color 
IT is a rule that Every Pleading by way of Confession and Avoidance must Give Color. “Color”, as a Term of 
Pleading, signifies an apparent or prima fade right; and the meaning of the Rule that Every Pleading in Confession 


and Avoidance must Give Color is that it must admit an apparent right in the Opposite Party, and rely, therefore, 
on some New Matter by which that apparent right is defeated.”°

Thus, in an Action of Covenant on an indenture of lease, for not repairing, suppose the defendant Pleads a 
Release by Way of Confession and Avoidance, thus: “And the said C. D. by X. Y., his Attorney, comes and defends 
the wrong and injury, when, etc., and says that the said AS. ought not to have or maintain his aforesaid action 
against him, the said CD., because he says that after the said Breach of Covenant, and before the Corn. 
mencement of this Suit, to wit the said A.B. by his certain deed of release, Sealed with his Seal and now 
shown to the Court here, did remise, release,” etc., all Damages from said Breach of Covenant, etc. This Plea Gives 
Color to the Declaration, for it admits an apparent right in the plaintiff, namely, that the defendant did, as alleged 
in the Declaration, execute the deed, and break the Covenant therein contained, and would, therefore, prima fade 
be chargeable with Damages on that ground; but it goes on and shows new matter, not before disclosed, by 
which that apparent right is shown not to exist, namely, that the plaintiff executed a release, Suppose the plaintiff 
files a Replication to this Plea, saying that at the time of making the said supposed deed of Release, he was 
unlawfully imprisoned by the defendant, until, by force and duress of that imprisonment, he made the supposed 
deed of release, etc. Here the plaintiff in his Replication Gives Color to the Plea. He impliedly admits that the 
defendant has priflla fade a good Defense, namely, that such Re.

Pleas in Confession and Avoidance must either expressly or impliedly admit that the Allegations in the Declaration are true, with a 
statement of matter which destroys their effect, and must confess a prima fade Right of Action in the opposite party, and then state 
new matter by which that apparent right Is defeated. Bavarian Brewing Ca v. Eetkowski, 1 W.W.Harr, 225, 113 A. 903

lease was executed as alleged in the Plea, and that the defendant, therefore, is apparently Discharged, but he sets up 
New Matter by which the effect of the Plea is avoided, namely, that the Release was obtained by duress. 

Suppose, on the other hand, the plaintiff, instead of Replying as above stated, should Reply that the Release was 
executed by him, but to another person, and not to the defendant. This Replication would be bad as a Replication in 
Confession and Avoidance, for Wanting Color, because, if the Release were not to the defendant, there would not 
exist even an apparent Defense, requiring the Allegation of New Matter to avoid it; and the Plea might be 
sufficiently answered by a Traverse, denying that the deed stated in the Plea is the deed of the plaintiff. So, in an 
Action of Trespass Quare Clausum Fregit, where the Declaration charges the defendants with breaking and 
entering the plaintiffs close, a Plea by Way of Confession and Avoidance is bad, as Wanting Color, where it alleges 
that at the time of the alleged Trespass one of the defendants was seised in tail of the said close, and the other 
defendant in possession of it, as his lessee for years, since, if this be so, it follows that the plaintiff has not even a 
colorable right to maintain the Action as for Trespass to his close.* In such 


463 


sı SO, in Trespass de bonis Asportatis, a Plea that the goods in question were the property of a third person, and that the defendant took 
them by virtue of an attachment against him, is bad, as amounting to the General Issue, for it involves a denial of the plaintiff s 
possession, and therefore gives no color to the Action. The thing to do in such a case, as We shall see, is to give express color. See, 
in support and illustration of the text, Brown v. Artcher, 1 Hill (N.Y.) 266; Collet v. Flinn, 5 Cow. (N.Y.) 466. 


In Conger v. Johnston, 2 Denio (N.Y.) 96, it was held that a Plea of the Statute of Limitations averring that “the severai Causes of 
Action, etc., if any such there were or still are, did not accrue within,” etc., was bad for want of color. “Every Plea In Confession and 
Avoidance,” It was said, “must give color, by admitting an apparent or prima fade right in the plaintiff, It must either expressly or 
impliedly confess that, but for the matter of avoidance contained in the Plea, the Action could be maintained. 

a case the usual and regular course would be, not to Plead in Confession and Avoidance, but to plead the General 

Issue, Not Guilty, which puts the plaintiff’ s possession of the close in issue, as well as the mere fact of the 

Trespass. 


The tacit admission, by failure to Deny, which we have just been considering, has been called “Implied Color,” to 
distinguish it from another kind, which is in some instances inserted in the Pleading, and is therefore called “Express 


Page 485 of 735 


Color.” ss 


Where the Nature of the Defense is such that it would contradict the plaintiff’s prima fade case, the defendant 
cannot Plead it 


This Plea makes no such confession, and is therefore bad. Instead of saying, as the pleader should have done, that the several Causes 
of Action mentioned in the Declaration did not accrue within six years, the words are that the several supposed Causes of Action mentioned 
in the Declaration, ‘if any such there were, or still are, did not accrue within six years. The defendants do not admit that but for the statute 
of Limitations the plaintiff could have sued.” 


And see Margetts v. Bays, 4 Ado]. & B. 489, 111 Bug. Rep. 871 (1836); Gould v. Lashury, 1 Cr., M. & Ii. 254, 140 Eng.Rep. 1075 (1834), 
(where, in an Action of Debt on Simple Contract, a Plea that the defendant was discharged under tile insolvent debtor’s act from the debts and 
Causes of Action, “if any,” etc. was held bad). 


But see, contra, Wise v. Hodsoll, 11 Adol. & E. SIB, 113 Engltep. 024 (1541), where, in an Action of Trespass for assault and battery, a 
Flea, that “if any hurt or damage happened or was occasioned” to the plaintiff, it was by reason of the defendants acting in self-defense, 
etc., was sustained. 


88. “The learned Serjeant Williams, whose notes upon Saunders’ Reports arc often cited in this work; was a gentleman of very florid 
complexion, which circumstance gave the irreverent youth of the bar occasion to say that he bad much express color. Tradition Informs 
us also that the same Serjeant Williams had a country place near Londoji, to which he was wont to resort for the week-end, and that he 
drove a horse which was given to balking; whereupon it was commented, hew strange it was that a horse belonging to s~ learned a pleader 
should demur when he ought to go to the country.” Kcigwin, Precedents of Pleading at Common Law, 554 (Washington, fl C., 1910).

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Cli. 22 
Specially without giving Express Color in order to have something to avoid. 


Express Color is defined to be “a feigned matter pleaded by the defendant in an Action of Trespass, from which 
the plaintiff seems to have a good cause of action, whereas he has in truth only an Appearance or Color of Cause.” so 
It is the setting up of a straw man, in order to have something to knock down. It occurs at present only in Trespass, 
and is very seldom used even in that action. Its use and nature may be thus explained: The necessity of an Implied 
Color has evidently the effect of obliging the Pleader to Traverse in many instances in which his case, when fully 
stated, does not turn on a mere Denial of Fact, but involves some consideration of Law. In the example first above 
given of Want of Color, this would not be so, for if the deed of Release were executed, not to the defendant, but to a 
different person, this, of course, amounts to no more than a mere Denial that the deed, as alleged in the Plea, is the 
deed of the plaintiff, and no Question of Law can be said to arise tmder this Traverse. But, in the second example 
given above of want of Implied Color, suppose the plaintiff was in the wrongful possession of the close, without 
any further appearance of title than the possession itself, at the time of the trespass alleged and that the defendants 
entered in the assertion of their title, They could not, without more, set forth their title in a Plea by Way of 
Confession and Avoidance, because, as we have seen, it would not Give Color,

See, also, Tbaycr, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, e. V, Law and Fact In Jury Trlals, 232—234 (Boston, 
1598), on Express Color as a method of withdrawing questions from the Jury by Pleading in confession and Avoidance. 


and they would therefore be driven to Plead the General Issue, Not Guilty. By this Plea an issue is produced, 
whether or not the defendants are guilty of the Trespass; but upon Trial of the Issue it may be found that the question 
turns entirely upon Construction of Law. The defendants say they are not guilty of breaking the “close of the plain- 
tiff,’ as alleged in the Declaration, and the reason that they are not guilty is that they had the title and right to 
possession of the close. Their title involves a legal question, and yet this question, under the plea of Not Guilty, 
would be triable by the Jury under Instructions by the Court. The defendants may wish to avoid this, and to bring 
the question up for decision by the Court, instead of by the Jury. They can do this if they cam set forth their 
Title Specially in their Plea, for then the plaintiff, if disposed to question the sufficiency of the title, may Demur to 


Page 486 of 735 


the Plea, and thus refer the legal question to the Court. But such a Plea, as we have seen, if Pleaded simply 
according to the fact, would be bad for Want of Color. This difficulty was overcome by the practice of giving Ex- 
press Color to the Plea in lieu of the Implied Color which was wanting. It is done by inserting in the Plea a 
Fictitious Allegation of some Colorable but Insufficient Title in the plaintiff, which was at the same time avoided 
by showing the Preferable Title of the-defendant. This was called “Giving Color,” and it was held to cure or 
prevent the objection which would otherwise arise from the want of Implied Color. Such a Plea Con-. teased 
some apparent title in the plaintiff, as a demise under which he entered and was possessed, and therefore 
admits that the close was in some sense the close of the plain-tiff, but at the same time it avoids this colorable 
title by showing that of the defendant, and alleging that the plaintiff’s title under the demise was defective in 
Point of Law, and that nothing passed under the demise. 
Sec. 228 
PLEAS—PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 
465 

When Express Color was thus given, the plaintiff was not allowed, In his Replication, to Traverse the Fictitious 
Matter suggested by Way of Color; for, its only object being to prevent a difficulty in Form, such Traverse would 
be wholly foreign to the merits of the cause, and would only serve to frustrate the Fiction which the Law, in such 
case, allows. The plaintiff would therefore pass over the Color without notice, and would either Traverse the title 
of the defendant, if he meant to contest its truth in Point of Fact, or Demur to it, if lie meant to contest its 
sufficiency in Point of Law; and thus the defendant would obtain his object of bringing any legal question 
raised upon his title under consideration of the Court, and withdrawing it from the Jury. 


Express Color must consist of such matter as, if it were effectual, would maintain the nature of the action.~ On 
the other hand, the right suggested must be colorable only, and must not amount to a real or actual right; for 
otherwise the plaintiff would be entitled to recover on the defendant’s own showing, and the Plea would be an 
insufficient answer.°! 


PLEADINGS IN ESTOPPEL 


227. A Plea in Estoppel is one which neither Confesses nor Avoids, but Pleads a previous inconsistent Act, 
Aliegation, or Denial of the Party which precludes him from maintaining his Action or Defense. 


A MAN is sometimes precluded in law from alleging or denying a fact in consequence of his own previous 
Act, Allegation, or Denial of a contrary tenor; and this preclusion is called an Estoppel. An Estoppel may arise 
either from Matter of Record,— from the deed of the party,—or from Matter in Pals, that is, matter of fact. Thus, 
any 


90. Comyns, Digest of the Laws of England, “Pleader,” 3, M. 41 (New York, 1825). 


Di. Radford v. Harbyn, Cro.Jac. 122, 79 Eng.Rep. 106 

matter adjudicated in a Court of Record will forever preclude the party from afterwards contesting the same fact in a 
subsequent suit with his adversary. This is an Estoppel by Matter of Record. As an instance of an Es~ toppel by 
Deed may be mentioned the case of a bond reciting a certain fact. The party executing the bond will be precluded 
from afterwards denying, in any action brought upon that instrument, the fact so recited. An example of an Estoppal 
by Matter in Pais occurs when one man has accepted rent of another. He will be estopped from afterwards denying, 
in any action with that person, that he was at the time of such acceptance his tenant. The tenant is likewise estopped 
to deny his landlord’s title. 


This doctrine of law gives rise to a Kind of Pleading that is neither by Way of Traverse nor Confession and 
Avoidance, viz.: a Pleading that, waiving any Question on the Fact, relies merely on the Estoppel; and, after stating 
the previous Act, Allegation, or Denial on the Opposite Party, Prays Judgment if he shall be received or admitted to 
aver contrary to what he before did or said.°~ This is called a Pleading by Way of Estoppel. It may be interposed 
instead of a Traverse, without admitting Traversable Averments on the other sideY*

verse.” Thus, in an Action of Covenant on an indenture, a Plea of Release, as it does not Traverse the execution 
of the indenture, is taken to admit it, And a Replication of Duress to such a Plea, since it does not Traverse the 
Release, admits its execution. So, in an Action of Covenant on an indenture of lease, for failure to repair, a Plea 
Traversing the want of repair admits the indenture. The effect of such an admission is to Conclude the Party, 
even though the Jury should improperly go out of the Issue and find the contrary of what is thus Confessed on the 
Record?” 

The Rule extends only to such Matters as are Traversable. Matters of Law, therefore, or any other matters 
which are not fit subjects of Traverse, are not so admitted.°°

PROTESTATION 


229. A Traversable Fact in Pleading may be passed over without Traverse, and the right to contest it in 
another action preserved by a Protestation in the Pleading in the present action. A Protestation has no effect 
in the existing suit. Now that several Pleas may he used, there is little, if any, need for Protestation. 


Page 488 of 735 


THE practice of Protestation of Facts not Denied arose where the Pleader, wishing to avail himself of the right to 
contest in a future action some Traversable Fact in the pending action, passes it by without Traverse, but at the same 
time makes a declaration collateral or incidental to his main Pleading, importing that the Fact so passed over is 
untrue. The necessity for this arose from the Rule that Pleadings must not be double, and that Every Pleading is 
taken to Admit such Matters as it does not Traverse.” Such being its only purpose, it is wholly without effect in 
the action in which it occurs, as, notwithstanding its use, every Traversable Fact not Traversed is taken as Admitted 
in the existing suit. Now that Several Pleas may be employed, there seems no reason for not denying every 
Allegation that one does not wish to admit, and no occasion for Protestation. 


Suppose, in an Action of Assumpsit for goods sold, the defendant Pleads that he gave the plaintiff certain goods 
in full satisfaction and Discharge, etc., and that the plaintiff accepted them in full satisfaction and Discharge; 
and the plaintiff, while Traversing the acceptance, does not wish to admit the delivery of the goods to him, lest 
the deliv

This practice was abolished by a rule of Ililary Term and the admission ceased to be conclusive in subsequent actions.

ery; even though not accepted, might become the subject of dispute in some subsequent action. To accomplish this 
purpose he takes the delivery by Protestation, and Traverses the acceptance, in his Replication, thus: “And the said 
4.3. says, that by reason of anything in the said Plea alleged, he ought not to be barred from having and maintaining 
his aforesaid action against the said C.D., because, Protesting that the said O.D. did not give or deliver to him, the 
said .4.3., the said goods as the said C.D. hath above in Pleading alleged, for Replication, nevertheless, in this 
behalf, the said .4.3. says that he, the said .4.3., did not accept the said goods in full satisfaction and Discharge of 
the said Promises and Undertakings, and of all Damages accrued to the said .4.3. by reason of the Nonperformance 
thereof, in Manner and Form as the said C.D. hath above alleged; and this the said .4.3. Prays may be inquired of by 
the country.” 


As stated above, the only object and effect of the Protestation is to allow the party to pass by a Fact without 
Traversing it, and without precluding himself from disputing it in another suit. It is wholly without effect in the 
action in which it occurs. Under the Rule already laid down, every Traversable Fact not Traversed is, 
notwithstanding the Protestation, to be taken as admitted in the existing suit.°° 


It is also given as a Rule, that if upon the Traverse the Issue is found against the Party Protesting the 
Protestation does not avail; and that it is of no use except in the event of the Issue being determined in his 
favor; with this Exception, however, that if the Matter taken by Protestation be such as the Pleader could not have 
taken Issue upon, the Protestation in that case shall avail, even

though the Issue taken were decided against him.” 


ARGUMENTATIVE PLEAS 


230. As a Pleading is a Statement of the Operative Facts which constitute the Plaintiff’s Cause of Action or the 
Defendant’s Defense, and not of evidence or argument, it must set forth its Allegations of Fact in a Direct and 
Positive Form, and not leave them to be collected by Inference and argument only. 


IT is a branch of this Rule that Two Affirmatives do not make a Good Negative; nor Two Negatives a Good 


Page 489 of 735 


Affirmative. The reason for this Rule is that not only must precision be observed in Allegations of Material Facts, 
but the Adverse Party must be enabled to Traverse such Allegations by a Direct and Distinct Denial. 


Thus, for example, if a defendant, instead of Pleading Performance of a Covenant Generally or Specially, as 
might be proper, alleges simply that he has not broken his covenant, he leaves the Fact of Performance to be inferred 
from that of the covenants not being broken, so that the Former Fact cannot be directly put in Issue by a Traverse of 
the Plea; and the Plea is therefore bad.! 


In an Action of Trover for ten pieces of money the defendant Pleaded that there was a wager between the plaintiff 
and one C concerning the quantity of yards of velvet in a cloak, and the plaintiff and C each delivered into the 


defendant’s hand ten pieces of money, to be delivered to C if there were ten yards of velvet in the cloak, and if not, 
to the

On the subject of argumentativeness, see the ease of Moses v. Allen, 01 Md. 42, 50, 46 A. 323 (1900), in which the Flea set forth 
reasons which properly were Matters of Evhlence, and hence could not be traversed except by a replication of the same faulty character. 
The Demurrer, therofore, was properly sustained.

plaintiff; and proceeded to allege that, upon measuring of the cloak, it was found that there were ten yards of velvet 

therein, whereupon the defendant delivered the pieces of money to C. Upon Demurrer, Gawdy held the Plea to be 

good enough, “for the measuring thereof is the fittest way for the trying it: 

and when it is so found by the measuring, he had good cause to deliver them out of his hands to him who had won 

the wager. But Fenner and Popham held, that the Plea was not good: for it may be that the measuring was false, and 

therefore he ought to have Averred in fact, that there were ten yards, and that it was so found upon tile measuring 

thereof.” 2 


So, in an Action of Trespass, for taking and carrying away the plaintiff's goods, the defendant Pleaded that the 
plaintiff never had any goods. “This is an infallible argument that the defendant is Not Guilty, and yet it is no Plea.” 


Again, in Ejectment, the defendant Pleaded a surrender of a copyhold by the hand of Fosset, then Steward of the 
Manor. The plaintiff Traversed that Fosset was Steward. All the Court held this to be No Issue, and that the Traverse 
ought to be that he did not surrender; for if he were not Steward, the surrender is void.“ The reason of this 


2. Ledesham v. Lubram, Cro.Eliz. 870, 78 Eng.Itep. 

1096 (1602). 
decision appears to be that to Deny that Fosset was Steward could be only so far Material as it tended to show that 
the surrender was a nullity; and that it was, therefoi?e, an Argumentative Denial of the surrender, which, if intended 
to be Traversed, ought to be Traversed in a Direct Form. 


It is a Branch of this Rule that Two Affirmatives do not make a Good Issue.” The reason is that the Traverse by 
the Second Affirmative is Argumentative in its nature. 
Thus, if it be alleged by the defendant that a Party died seised in fee, and the Plaintiff alleged that he died seised 
in tail, this is not a Good Issue; ~ because the Latter Allega. tion amounts to a Denial of a seisin in fee, but denies it 
by Argument or Inference only. It is this Branch of the Rule against Argumentativeness that gave rise to the 
Form of a Special Traverse. Where, for any of the reasons mentioned in a preceding part of this work, it became 
expedient for a Party Traversing to set forth New Affirmative Matter tending to explain or qualify his Denial, he is 
allowed to do so; but as this, standing alone, will render his Pleading Argumentative, he is required to add to his 
Affirmative Allegation an Express Denial, which is held to cure or prevent the Argumentativeness.’ Thus, in the example 
last given, the plaintiff

may allege, if he pleases, that the Party died seised in tail; but then he must add, Absque Hoc, that he died siesed in 
fee, and thus resort to the Form of a Special Traverse.’ The doctrine, however, that Two Affirmatives do not make 
a Good issue, is not taken so strictly but that the Issue will, in some cases, be good, if there is sufficient Negative 
and Alfinnative in effect, though, in the Form of Words, there be a Double Affirmative. Thus, in Debt on a lease for 
years, where the defendant Pleaded that the plaintiff had nothing at the time of the lease made, and the plaintiff 
Replied that he was seised in fee, this was held a Good Issue.” 


Another Branch of the Rule against Argumentativeness is that Two Negatives do not make a Good Issue.’° 
Thus, if the defendant Plead that he requested the plaintiff to deliver an abstract of his title, but that the plaintiff 
did not, when so requested, deliver such abstract, but neglected so to do, the plaintiff cannot Reply that he did not 
neglect and refuse to deliver such abstract, but should Allege Affirmatively that he did deliver.” 


PLEAS AMOUNTING TO THE 
GENERAL ISSUE 


231. Where a Plea amounts to the General Issue, it should be so Pleaded. In other words, where the Matter of 
Defense may be raised under the General Issue in the Particular Action involved, it must be so Pleaded. This

IT is a well-established Rule of Pleading that, if Facts are alleged Specially which can be given in evidence 
under the General Issue, such Plea is obnoxious to Special Demurrer. The point has been frequently urged with success 
that a Special Plea amounted to the General Issue.’” If the General Issue can be used, then it must be used, and to 
employ a Specific Denial would be Bad in Form. Thus, even if the defendant wishes to Deny one of Several 
Material Elements making up the Cause of Action, thereby narrowing the issues of Fact, he is not allowed to do so. 
The reason or purpose of insisting upon the General Issue seems to have been that of avoiding making of Long 
Records and of Closing the Pleadings at an Early Stage.’

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Ch, 22 

It is clear, however, that Pleading the circumstances Specially has the advantage of presenting the Questions 
of Law on which the case turns and of making the Issue more Specific; yet the Rules of Common-Law Pleading 
defeated their own ends and purposes by insisting on the General Issue for the sake of the false appearance of 
singleness, simplicity, and brevity, and made the plaintiff prove what the defendant could not actually dispute. This 
abuse has been remedied to some extent under Modern Statutory Systems.” 


The following cases illustrate the General 
Rule: In an Action of Trespass for entering the plaintiff’s garden, the defendant Pleaded that the plaintiff had no 
such garden. This was Ruled to be No Plea, as it amounted to nothing more than “Not Guilty”; for, if he had no such 
garden, then the defendant was Not Guilty. So the defendant withdrew his Plea, and said, “Not Guilty.” 15 


So, in Trespass for Depasturing the plaintiff s herbage, “Non depascit herbas” is No Plea; it should be “Not 
Guilty” 16 


So, in Debt for the price of a horse sold, 
that the defendant did not buy is No Plea, for it amounts to Nil Debet.” 


Again, in Trespass for entering the plaintiff's house and keeping possession thereof for a certain time, the 
defendant Pleaded that J.S. was seised in fee thereof, and, being so seised, gave License to the defendant to

Pleading, and tend, not only to destroy the settled distinctions between the different species of pleas, but also to the introduction of 
New Pleas, unknown to the Law.” Gould, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading, Pt. III, Div. V, c. 11, 519 (6th ed. by Wilh, Albany, 
1009). 


fl. In Vermont, the fact that a Special Plea aiuorn]ts to the General Issue, did not make It objectionable nuder the Practice Act. Roberts v.

enter into and possess the house, till he should give him notice to leave it; that thereupon the defendant 
entered and kept the house for the time mentioned in the Declaration, and had not any notice to leave it, all 
the time. The plaintiff Demurred Specially, on the ground that this Plea amounted to the General Issue, “Not 
Guilty”; and the Court gave Judgment on that ground for the plaintift’* 


So, in an Action of Trover for divers loads 
of corn, the defendant in his Plea entitled himself to them as tithes severed. The plaintiff Demurred Specially, on the 
ground that the Plea “amounted but to Not Guilty,” and the Court gave Judgment for the plaintitL'~ 

So, in Trespass for Breaking and Entering 
the Plaintiff's Close, if the defendant Pleads a demise to him by the plaintiff, by virtue whereof he (the defendant) 
entered and was possessed, this is bad, as amounting to the General Issue, “Not Guilty.” 20 


So, in Debt on a Bond, the defendant, by his Plea, confessed the bond, but said that it 
was executed to another person, and not to the plaintiff. This was held bad, as amounting to Non Est Facttcm.°’ 


These examples show that a Special Plea thus improperly substituted for the General Issue may be sometimes in a 
Negative, sometimes in an Affirmative Form. When in the Negative, its Argumentativeness will often serve as an 
additional test of its faulty quality. Thus, the Plea in the first example, “that 


iS. Saunder’s Case, 12 Mod. 513, 88 Eng.Rop. 1486 (1701),

the plaintiff had no such garden,” is evidently but an Argumentative Allegation that the defendant did not commit, 
because he could not have committed, the trespass. This, however, does not universally hold; for in the second and third 
examples the Allegations that the defendant “did not depasture,” and “did not buy,” seem to be in as Direct a Form 
of Denial as that of Not Guilty. If the Plea be in the Affirmative, the following considerations will always tend to 
detect the improper construction: If a Good Plea, it must, as heretofore shown, be taken either as a Traverse or as in 
Confession and Avoidance. Now, taken as a Traverse, such a Plea is clearly open to the Objection of Argumen- 
tativeness; for as we have seen, Two Affirmatives make an Argumentative Issue. Thus, in the fourth example, the 
Allegations show that the house in question was the house of J.B., and they therefore Deny Argumentatively that it 
was the house of the plaintiff as stated in the Declaration. On the other hand, if a Plea of this kind be intended by Way 
of Confession and Avoidance, it is bad for Want of Color, for it admits no apparent right in the plaintiff. Thus, in 
the same example, if it be true that J.S. was seised in fee and gave License to the defendant to enter, who entered 
accordingly, this excludes all title of possession in the plaintiff, and without such title he has No Color to maintain 


Page 493 of 735 


an Action of Trespass.” So, in the example where the defendant Pleads the plaintiff's own demise, the same 
observation applies; for if the plaintiff demised to the defendant, who entered accordingly, the plaintiff would then 
cease to have any title of possession, and he consequently has No Color to support an Action of Trespass. 


The fault of Wanting Color being in this manner connected with that of amounting to The General Issue, it is 
accordingly held that a Plea will be saved from the latter fault 
where Express Color is given,” Thus, in the example of Express Color given, in a former part of this work, the Plea 
is cured, by the Fictitious Color of Title there given to the plaintiff, of the objection to which it would otherwise be 
sub ject—that it amounts to Not Guilty. So, where sufficient Implied Color is given, a Plea will never be open to this 
kind of objection. And it is further to be observed that, where sufficient Implied Color is given, the Plea will be 
equally clear of this objection, even though it consist of matter which might be given in evidence under the General 
Issue. Defendants are allowed, in certain actions, to prove, under this Issue, matters in the Nature of Confession and 
Avoidance, as, for example, in Assumpsit, a Release or Payment. In such cases the plaintiff, though allowed, is 
not obliged, to Plead Non Assumpsit, but may, if he pleases, Plead Specially the Payment or Release; and, if he does, 
such Plea is not open to the objection that it amounts to the General Issue.” 

It is said that the Court is not bound to 
allow this objection, but that it is in its discretion to allow a Special Plea amounting to the General Issue, if it involve 
such Matter of Law as might be unfit for the decision of a Jury.” It is also said that, as the Court has such 
discretion, the proper method of taking advantage of this fault is not by Demurrer,

but by Motion to the Court to set aside the Plea and enter the General Issue instead of it.” By the clear weight of 
authority, however, the objection is also ground for Special Demurrer. The objection may and must be raised either 
by Motion or Special Demurrer.” 


As a Plea amounting to the General Issue is usually open also to the objection of being Argumentative, or that of 
Wanting Color, we sometimes find the Rule in question discussed as if it were founded entirely in a view to those 
objections. This, however, says Stephen, does not seem to be a sufficiently wide foundation for the. Rule; for there 
are instances of Pleas which are faulty, as amounting to the General Issue, which yet do not seem fairly open to the 
objection of Argumentativeness, and which, on the other hand, being of the Negative Kind or by way of Traverse, 
require No Color. Besides, there is Express Authority for holding that the true object of this Rule is to avoid prolixity, 
for it is laid down that “the reason of pressing a General Issue is not for Insufficiency of the Plea, but not to make 
Long Records when “there is no cause.” 28 


PARTIAL DEFENSES

THE effect of this Rule is that a Pleading must fully meet the cause of action stated by answering the Whole of it, 
or all that is Material. If it fails in this, it is bad.”° 


Thus, in Trespass for breaking a close and cutting down 300 trees, if the defendant Pleads some Matter of 
Justification or title as to all but 200 trees, and says nothing as to the 200, his Plea is bad. 


As to the proper course for the plaintiff 
to take in such cases there is some doubt, and a conflict in the authorities. It is said by Stephen that there is a 
distinction in a case where the defendant does not Profess to Answer the Whole, and a case where, by the 
Commencement of his Plea, he does Profess to do so, but in fact gives a Defective and Partial Answer, applying to 
part only. He says that in the former case, that is, where the defendant does not Profess to Answer the Whole, the 
plaintiff is entitled to sign Judgment as by Ni? Dic ’it against him in respect of that part of the cause of action not 
answered, and to Demur or Reply to the Plea as to the remainder; and, on the other

hand, if he Demurs or Replies to the Plea without signing Judgment for the part not answered, the whole action is 
said to be discontinued.*° For the Plea, if taken by the plaintiff as an Answer to the Whole Action, it being in fact a 
Partial Answer only, is, in contemplation of Law, a mere nullity; and there is consequently an interruption or 
chasm in the Pleading, which is called in technical phrase a “Discontinuance.” And such Discontinuance will amount to 
Error on the Record.”! Where, however, the defendant does Profess to Answer the Whole Declaration, but in fact 
gives a Defective Answer, applying to a Part only, this amounts merely to Insufficient Pleading, and the plaintiff s 
course, therefore, is not to sign Judgment for the Part Defectively Answered, but to Demur to the Whole Plea.”

Some Courts have refused to recognize any such distinction as this, and hold that where the Plea does not Profess 
to Answer the Whole Declaration, as well as in cases where it does so Profess, the plaintiff may Demur to the Plea 
as a Whole as Insufficient in Law, or Reply to it, and need not enter Judgment, for the Part Unanswered, as by Ni?

Where that Part of the Pleading to which no Answer is given is Immaterial, or such as requires no Separate or 

Specific Answer, as, for instance, where it is mere Matter of Aggravation, the Rule does not apply.” 


Again, if any Pleading be intended to apply to Part Only of the Matter Adversely Alleged, it must be qualified 
accordingly in its Commencement and Conclusion.”

Material Fact, or in reference to any of the Material Things which it undertalies to Answer, or as to either of the 
Parties Answering. though otherwise free from objection, the Whole is open to Demurrer. 


BY the proper Forms of Commencement 
and Conclusion, the matter which any Pleading contains is offered either as an Entire or as a Partial Answer to the 


Page 496 of 735 


Whole af that which last preceded. If it falls in any Material Part, it fails altogether?° Thus, if in a Declaration of 
Assumpsit Two Different Promises be alleged in Two Different Counts, and the defendant Plead in Bar to both 
counts conjointly the statute of limitations, viz., that he did not Promise within six years, and the Plea be an insuff 
icient answer as to one of the Counts, but a good Bar to the other, the Whole Plea is bad, and Neither Promise is 
sufficiently answered.*’ So, where to an Action of Trespass for False Imprisonment against two defendants they 
Pleaded that one of them, A., having ground to believe that his horse had been stolen by the plaintiff, gave him in 
charge to the other defendant, a constable, whereupon the constable and A., in his aid and by his command, laid hands 
on the plaintiff, etc., the Plea was adjudged to be bad as to both defendants, because it showed no reasonable ground 
of suspicion; for A. could not Justify the Arrest without showing such ground; and though the case might be 
different as to the constable, whose duty was to act on the

This Rule seems to result from that which requires each Pleading to have its proper Formal Commencement and 
Conclusion; for by those Forms, it will be observed, the Matter which any Pleading contains is offered as an Entire 
Answer to the Whole of that which last preceded. Thus, in the first example above given, the defendant would 
allege, in the Commencement of his Plea, that the plaintiff “ought not to have or maintain his action” for the reason 
therein assigned; and therefore he would Pray Judgment, etc., as to the Whole Action in the Conclusion. If, therefore, 
the answer be insufficient as to One Count, it cannot avail as to the other; because, if taken as a Plea to the latter 
only, the Commencement and Conclusion would be wrong. It is to be observed that there is but One Plea, and 
consequently but One Commencement and Conclusion; but if the defendants should Plead the Statute in Bar to the 
First Count separately, and then Plead it to the Second Count with a New Commencement and Conclusion, thus 
making Two pleas instead of One, the invalidity of One of these Pleas could not vitiate the other. 


As the Declaration, like the General Issue, has neither Formal Commencement nor Conclusion of the kind to 
which the last Rule relates, it does not fall within the scope of the one under consideration. A Declaration may be 
Good in Part, and Bad as to Another Part, relating to a distinct demand divisible from the rest; and if the defendant 
Plead to the Whole, instead of to the Defective Part Only, the Judgment will be for the plaintiff.

Singleness of issue 

IT was the avowed object of Common-Law Pleading to reduce the controversy of the parties to a Single Material 
Issue decisive of the case. If a defendant had Several Defenses, the Common Law required him to make his Election 
between them and rest his 

one selected. In Whitaker v. Chief Justice Marshall says: 

“The principle in Pleading that a Special Plea must Confess and Avoid the fact charged in the Declaration was 
introduced at a time when the Rigid Practice of the Courts required that every cause should be placed on a Single 
Point, and when it was deemed error to Plead Specially Matter which Amounted to the General Issue; it was 
not allowed to Deny the Fact and also to Justify it. The defendant might select his Point of Defense; but, when 
selected, he was confined to it. 
That a Single Point might be presented to the Jury, he was under the necessity of Confessing everything but that 
point. The attention of the Jury was not directed to Multifarious Objects, but confined to one on which alone the 
cause depended.” ~ 


The Rule is well settled that No Plea or Traverse can be good which embraces Different Matters, which cannot be 
brought within the scope of One Issue." A Plea or 


a. Whitaker v. Freeman, 12 N.C. 271, Fed.Cas.No. 
17,527a, 29 FeciCas. 955 (C.C.1S27). 


42. Originally, at Common Law, the plaintiff was allowed to plead only One Plea in Bar, as the great aim of Pleading n-as to reduce the 
controversy to a Single, Clear-Cut, Well-Defined Issue for the Jury, and thereby simplify the Investigation. By use of the various 
General Issues, Singleness of the Issue early became a fiction, since the Issue, though apparently single in words, was in reality 
Complex. 


43. Comyn, Digest, Pleader, E. 2 (London, 1522). 


Every Plea must be Simple, Entire, Connected, and Confined to a Single Point, and a Ploa sotting up more than one Indcpcndent fact or set of

Replication, therefore, must contain but One Complete Answer to the last Opposing Pleading, the principle being 
that, as One such AnSwer, if maintained, is sufficient to defeat the Action or Defense, all others are superfluous.“ It 
is not necessary, however, that the Single Ground of Defense or Answer to which each Flea or Replication is thus 


Page 498 of 735 


limited shall consist of a Single Fact,” since several connected or dependent Facts or circumstances may be necessary 
to constitute a Single or Complete Answer. In such a case the fault of Duplicity cannot exist, as such Facts con- 
stitute, in fact, but a Single Answer.*° 


The Rule against Duplicity in the Plea 
does not prevent a defendant from giving Several Distinct Answers to Different Matters of Claim in the Declaration. 
A defendant may therefore Plead the General Issue to One Part of the Declaration, and Matter in Confession and 
Avoidance to the residue, or One Matter of Abatement to One Part, and 


or Both. Florida East Coast By. Co. v. Peters, 72 Pla. 311, 73 So. 151 (1918).

Another to Another Part, or may Plead in Abatement to One Part of the Demand, and in Bar as to Another.~’ To 
Several Counts, or to distinct parts of the Same Count, he may therefore Plead Several Pleas; that is, one to each. 

Thus, in an Action of trespass for three assaults and batteries, the defendant may Plead Not Guilty to the First 
Count; in Excuse—Self-Defense--—to the Second; and the Statute of Limitations to the Third. The reason is that the 
Different Matters so Pleaded are not alleged to the Same Point, and therefore do not tend to produce Several Issues 
as to that point.~ The Rule applies equally to the Replication and Other Subsequent Pleadings in the series, a 
severance being always proper when there are Several Subjects of Claim or Complaint. This right, however, of thus 
Pleading Distinct Matters, appears to be subject to the restriction that neither of the Separate Defenses thus alleged can 
be such as would alone constitute a sufficient Answer to the Whole of the Opposing Claim, since then one only 
would be necessary.” 


It may often happen that the defendant may have Several Distinct Answers to give to the Same Claim or 
Complaint. Thus, in an Action of Trespass for two assaults and batteries, he may have ground to Deny both the 
trespasses, and also to allege that neither 
of them was committed within the period of the Statute of Limitations. Prior, however, to the Statutory 
Regulation which we shall

presently notice, it was not competent for him to thus Plead Several Answers to the Same Claim, as that would have 
been an infringement of the Rule against Duplicity.”” He was therefore obliged to Elect between his Different 
Defenses, Where more than one thus happened to present themselves, and to rely on that which, in Point of Law 
and Fact, he might deem best. But as a mistake in that selection might occasion the loss of the cause, contrary to the 
real merits of the case, this restriction against the use of Several Pleas to the same matter, after being for ages 
observed in its original severity, was at length considered as contrary to the true principles of justice. 


The Rule was changed by the Statute of 4 Anne, c. 16, § 4, 11 Statutes at Large 156 (1705). That section provides 
that “it shall and may be lawful for any defendant or tenant In any Action or Suit, or for any plaintiff in 
Replevin, in any Court of Record, with the leave of the same Court, to Plead as Many Several Matters thereto as 
he shall think necessary for his Defense,” This statute is old enough to have become a part of our Common Law, 
but in most states substantially the same provision has been expressly enacted. Since this Act the course has been 
for the defendant, if he wishes to Plead Several Matters to the same Subject of Demand or Complaint, to apply 
previously I or a Rule of Court permitting him to do so; and upon this a Rule is accordingly drawn up for That 
purpose.” 


When Several Pleas are Pleaded, either to Different Matters, or, by virtue of the Statute, to the Same Matter, the 
plaintiff may, according to the nature of his case, either Demur to the Whole, or Demur to One Plea 


M. See dictum Jn Auburn & Onwasco Canal Co. v. Leltch, 4 Denlo (N.Y.) 65 (1847). 


~1. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleadlug In Civil Actions, e. It, Of the Principal Rules of Pleading, § 3, p. 263 (3d Am. 
ed. by Tyler, Washington, D. C. 1875). 

and Reply to the Other, or make a Several Replication to each Plea; and in the Two Latter cases the result 
may be a corresponding Severance in the Subsequent Pleadings, and the Production of Several Issues. But, 
whether One or More Issues be produced, if the decision, whether in Law or Fact, be in the defendant’s favor, as to 
any One or More Pleas, he is entitled to Judgment, though he fail as to the remainder; that is, he is entitled to 
Judgment in respect of that Subject of Demand or Complaint to which the successful Plea relates, and, if it were 
Pleaded to the Whole Declaration, to Judgment generally, though the plaintiff should succeed as to all the Other 
Pleas. 


By a relaxation similar to that which has obtained with respect to Several Counts, the use of Several Pleas, 
though presumably intended by the Statute to be allowed only in a case where there are really Several Grounds of 
Defense,” is, in practice, carried much further. For it was soon found that, when there was a Matter of Defense by 
Way of Special Plea, it was generally expedient to Plead that Matter in company with the General Issue, whether 
there were any real ground £ or denying the Declaration or not; because the effect of this is to put the plaintiff to 
the Proof of his Declaration before it can become necessary for the defendant to establish his Special Plea; and thus 
the defendant has the chance of succeeding, not only on the strength of his own case, but by the failure of the 
plaintiff s Proof. Again, as the plaintiff, in the case of Several Counts, finds it convenient to vary the Mode of Stating 
the Same Subject of Claim, so, for similar reasons, defendants were led, under Color of Pleading Distinct 
Matters of Defense, to state variously, in Various Pleas, the Same Defense; and this either by presenting it in an 
entirely new view, or by omitting in One Plea some circumstances alleged in Another. To 
st. Clinton v. Morton, 2 SIr. 2000, 93 Eng.flop. 994 

(1734). 

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
this extent, therefore, is the use of Several Pleas now carried. 


Some efforts, however, were at one time made to restrain this apparent abuse of the indulgence given by the 
Statute; for that leave of the Court which the Statute requires was formerly often refused where the proposed Subjects 


Page 500 of 735 


of Plea appeared to be inconsistent, and on this ground leave has been refused to Plead to the same trespass, “Not 
Guilty” and “Accord and Satisfaction,” or “Non Est Factum” and “Payment” to the same demand.” In modern 
Practice, however, such Pleas, notwithstanding the apparent repugnancy between them, are permitted,” and the only 
Pleas, perhaps, which

Limitations, or in Trespass, Not Guilty, a Justification, and Accord and Satisfaction, etc. So he may Plead Non 
Assumpsit and Infancy, or Not Guilty and Libcrum Tenernentum; though, as Infancy may be given in evidence 
upon Non Assumpsit, and Liberurn Tenementum upon Not Guilty, the Pleading of these Matters Specially seems 
to be unnecessary.” s6

On the subject of Several Pleas it is to be further observed that the Statute extends to the case of Pleas only, and 
not to Replications or Subsequent Pleadings. These remain subject to the full operation of the Common Law Rule 
against Duplicity, so that, though to Each Plea there may, as already stated, be a Separate Replication, yet there 


cannot be offered to the same Plea more than a Single Replication,” nor to the same Replication more than One 


Page 501 of 735 


Rejoinder; and so to the end of the series. The legislative provision allowing Several Matters of Plea was confined to 
that case, under the impression, probably, that it was in that Part of the Pleading that the hardship of the Rule 
Against Duplicity was most seriously and frequenUy felt, and that the Multiplicity of Issues which would be 
occasioned by a further extension of the enactment would have been attended with expense and inconvenience 
more than equivalent to the advantage. The effect, however, of this state of Jaw is somewhat remarkable. For 
example, it empowers a defendant to Plead to a Declaration in Assumpsit for goods sold and delivered (1) the 
General Issue; (2) that the cause of action did not accrue within six years; (3) that he was an infant at the time of 
the contract. On the First Plea the plaintiff has only to Join Issue, but with respect to each of the Two Last he may 
have Several Answers to give. The case may be such as to afford either of these Replications to the Statute of 
Limitations, namely, that the cause of action did accrue within six years, or that at the time the cause of action 
accrued he was beyond sea, and that he commenced his Suit within six years after his return. So, to the Plea of 
Infancy, he may have ground for Replying, either that the defendant was not an infant, or that the goods for 
which the action is brought were necessaries suitable to the defendant’s condition in life. Yet, though the defendant 
had 


57- But compare Priest v. Dodsworth, 235 Ri. 612, 

619, 85 NE. 040, 942 (1005). 
the advantage of his Three Pleas cumulatively, the plaintiff is obliged to make his Election between these Several 
Answers, and can Reply but one of them to each Plea. 


It is also to be observed that the power of 
Pleading Several Matters extends to Pleas 
in Bar only, and not to those of the Dilatory 
Class, with respect to which the leave of the 
Court will not be granted.r~ 


Again, it is to be remarked that the Statute does not operate as a total abrogation, even with respect to pleas in 
Bar, of the Rule against Duplicity. For, first, it is necessary, as we have seen, to obtain the leave of the Court to 
make use of Several Matters of Defense, the application for leave being addressed to the discretion of the Court,” 
and then the Several Matters are Pleaded Formally, with the words, “by leave of the Court for this purpose first had 
and obtained.” The Several Defenses must also each be Pleaded as a New or Further Plea, with a Formal 
Commencement and Conclusion as such; so that, notwithstanding the Statute, and the leave of the court obtained in 
pursuance of it, to Plead Several Matters, it would still be improper to incorporate several matters in One Plea in 
any case in which the Plea would be thereby rendered Double at Common Law.°° 


As the Several Counts in the Declaration are required, apparently at least, to be distinct and complete 
Statements of Separate

Causes of Action, and are so considered and treated, so as stated above, each of Several Pleas, when Pleaded 
together, must be stated as a New or Further Plea, with Formal Commencement and Conclusion, and must stand 
and be treated as if Pleaded alone. One Plea cannot be taken in to help or destroy another, but Every Plea must stand

or fall by itself.” Neither can One Plea thus offered have the effect of dispensing with the Proof of what is Denied 
by another, or, in other words, be used to aid the plaintiff in evidence against the defendant, and thus disprove 
another.” 


Several Defendants iWay Plead Separately 

WHERE there are several defendants, each may Plead for himself a Single Matter of Defense to the Whole, or 
Different Matters to Different Parts of the Opposing Pleading, as if he was the only person charged; and, as each 
defendant may thus use a Separate Plea, all may join in that, if they so desire.” This does not apply, however, when 
several defendants, jointly charged in an action on contract, All Plead the Same Defense to the action; as, for 
instance, the General Issue, or the Same Matter in Confession and Avoidance, Here they cannot sever, but must join 
in One and the Same Plea, in presenting the Common Defense. The reason for this is that if they all agree as to the 
Nature of their Defense, as a joint ilability is sought to be enforced against them, all are as safe in thus

THIS Rule rests upon the principle, previously stated, that where One of Two or More Facts would constitute 
a sufficient ground of Defense, only One such Fact should be stated. If, therefore, a Pleading included Several 
Matters in Abatement or in Bar,” or contained One of each Character,” it would be Double, and hence fatal on a 
Special Demurrer. The same would be true in joining Several Matters in Confession and Avoidance, or Several 
Answers by Way of Traverse, or a Traverse with a Plea of the former kind~° 


DUPLICITY—IMMATERIAL MATTER 
236. Matter which is wholly Immaterial cannot operate to snake a Pleading Double. 


THIS is the result of a General Rule that Surplusage is to be disregarded, Where Matter is Pleaded which is 
wholly foreign to the cause, it is mere Surplusage, and will not therefore render a Pleading objectionable, under the 
Rule we are considering, even

though Pleaded in connection with what is Material. Such Matter will be rejected as Impertinent 67 and Superfluous, 
since it requires no answer, and it therefore cannot occasion the fault for which all Double Pleadings are 
objectionable, that is, a Multiplicity of Issues.” 


Thus, in an Action by the Executors of A on a bond conditioned that the defendant should warrant to A a certain 
meadow, the defendant Pleaded that the said meadow was copyhold of a certain Manor, and that there is a Custom 
within the Manor, that if the customary tenants fall in payment of their rents and services, or commit waste, 
then the lord for the time being may enter for forfeiture; and that the said A, during his life, peaceably enjoyed the 
meadow, which descended after his death to one B, his son and heir who, by his own wrong, entered without the 
admission of the lord, against the Custom of the Manor; and because three shillings of rent were in arrear on such a 
day, the lord entered into the meadow, as into lands forfeited. On Demurrer, it was objected (among other things) 
that the Plea was 


87. An Impertinent Averment is a statement of matter altogether foreign to the Merits of the Cause, and may, therefore, be struck out in 
its entirety, without injury to the pleading, and, of course, no proof of such an Allegation can be required; on fhe other hand, 
an immaterial Ave,ment must, in many cases, be proved, and is a statement of unnecessary particulars in connection with, and as 
descriptive of, What Is material. GouM, A Treatise On the Prin’ ciples of Pleading, Part III, Of Pleading, Div. II, Rules

A “Ica setting up two defenses, one of them bad, is riot Demurrable for duplicity. Guest Piano Co. v. Bicker, 274 III. 448, 113 N.E. 717 
(1910). 

Double; because in showing the forfeiture to have accrued by the heir’s own wrongful act, Two Several Matters 
are alleged: Ffrst, that he entered without admission, against the custom; secondly, that three shillings of rent 
were in arrear. But the Judges held that the only sufficient cause of forfeiture was the nonpayment of rent; that, there 
being No Custom alleged for forfeiture in respect of entry without admission, the Averment of such Entry was mere 
Surplusage and could not, therefore, avail to make the Plea Double.” It is, however, to be observed that the Plea 
seems to rely on the nonpayment of the rent as the only ground of forfeiture, for it alleges that “because three 
shillings of the rent were in arrear, the lord entered,” and the Court noticed this circumstance. The case, therefore, 
does not explicitly decide that where Two Several Matters are not only Pleaded, but relied upon, the Immateriality 
of one of them shall prevent Duplicity, but the manner in which the Judges express themselves seems to show that 
the doctrine goes to that extent; and there are other authorities who take the same view.” 


DUPLICITY—MATTER ILL PLEADED 


237. Material Matter, though Ill Pleaded, will occasion the Fault of Duplicity. 

ALTHOUGH Immaterial Matter is to be disregarded, that which is Material to the cause of Action or Defense, 
though stated in an insufficient manner, will render the Pleading open to objection as Double, when Pleaded in 
connection with other Issuable Facts. Such Matter cannot be treated as Surplusage, and, being Material, is therefore, 
Issuable though defectively alleged. It can neither be rejected as Superfluous, nor does it render the Plea void. It 
may, therefore, be stated that any Matter which, if Well Pleaded,

would give rise to Duplicity, will have the same effect when Ill Pleaded, especially if, in spite of such faulty 
statement, it would be Aided by a Verdict.” 


Page 504 of 735 


Thus, in an Action of Trespass for Assault and Battery where the defendant Pleaded that he committed the 
trespasses in the moderate correction of the plaintiff as his servant, and further, Pleaded that since that time the 
plaintiff had Discharged and Released to him the said trespasses, without alleging, as he ought to have done, a 
Release under Seal, the Court held that the Plea was Double, the moderate correction and the Release being each a 
Matter of Defense; and although the Release was insufficiently Pleaded, it was, nevertheless, a Matter upon which a 
Material Issue might have been taken, and hence it was sufficient to make the Plea Double.’7” 

This doctrine, that a Plea may be rendered Double by Matter Ill Pleaded, but not by Immaterial Matter, quite 
accords with the object of the Rule against Duplicity, as previously explainad. That object is the avoidance of 
Several Issues. So, whether a Matter be Well or Ill Pleaded, yet if it be suffi~ient in Substance, as to make it possible 
for the opposite party to take Issue upon it, if he chooses to Plead Over, without pressing the Formal Objection, such 
Matter tends to the Production of a Separate Issue, and is on that ground held to make the Pleading Double. On the 
other hand, if the matter be Immaterial, no Issue can properly be taken upon 
it. It does not, therefore, tend to a Separate Issue, nor, consequently, fall within the Rule against Duplicity. 


DUPLICITY—MATTERS FORMING A CONNECTED PROPOSITION 


238. No Number of Circumstances, however 
multifarious, that together constitute but One

Connected Proposition or Entire Point, will operate to make a Pleading Double. 


THE Rule against Duplicity has been qualified, not only as to Pleadings in Confession and Avoidance, but also as 
to Traverses; and a Party may therefore Deny, as well as Affirm, any Number of Circumstances that together Form 
but a Single Point or Proposition.” 


Thus, to an Action of Trespass for Assault and Imprisonment, if the defendant Plead that he arrested the plaintiff 
on suspicion of felony, he may set forth any Number of Circumstances of suspicion, though each circumstance, 
taken alone, may be sufficient to Justify the arrest; for, all of them, taken together, amount to one connected cause of 

os 14 
suspicion. 


And, in an Action of Trespass for breaking the plaintiff's close and depasturing it with cattle, the defendant 
Pleaded a right of common in the close for the said cattle, being his own commonable cattle, levant and couchant 
upon the premises. The plaintiff, in the Replication, Traversed “that the cattle were the defendant’s own cattle, and 
that they were levant and couchant upon the premises, and commonable cattle.” On Demurrer to the Replication for 
Duplicity, it was objected that

there were Three Distinct Facts put in Issue, any one of which would be sufficient by itself. But the Court held that 
the point of the Defense was that the cattle in question were entitled to common; that this point was Single, though it 
involved the Three Several Facts that the cattle were the defendant’s own, that they were levant and couehant, and 
that they were conimonable cattle; that the Replication Traversing these Facts, in effect, therefore, only Traversed 
the Single Point whether the cattle were entitled to common, and was consequently not open to the Objection of 
Duplicity. 


There is some difficulty in the application of this Rule in establishing a test between those cases in which Several 
Averments make up a Single Point, and may therefore be Alleged or Traversed together, and those in which each 
constitutes a Separate Point, though insufficient in itself as a Defense without union with the others. The governing 
principle seems to be that while each Successive Denial or Allegation in Pleading must contain no Superfluous 
Matter, and must be limited to what is strictly necessary to constitute a Good Defense or Reply to the Pleading it 
seeks to answer, it may still go as far, and cover as much ground, as may be requisite to attain that object. Therefore 
Two Distinct Facts cannot ordinarily be Averred or Denied Together, if the Proof or Disproof of one would be 
sufficient to defeat or maintain the action.” A qualification becomes necessary, however, where a Number of Dif- 
ferent Facts or Averments relate to one thing, or together make up a Single Proposition; and it seems that the Rule 
above stated will hold where the Averment of Several Connected Facts is necessary to make a Complete Defense, 
and that under it, where the Denial of any One of Such Facts would not be a Perfect Answer, a Replication will 
not be Double 


7~. Robinson v. Raley, 1 Burr. 316, 97 Eng.Rep. 330 (1757). 

which meets the Averments by Separate Denials of all, or by a Single General Denial. A Traverse thus made is 
called a “Cumulative Traverse.” The most frequent instance of its use occurs in the Replication Dc Injuria, which 
alleges that the defendant of his own wrong, and “without the cause alleged,” committed the act. This “cause” may 
consist of Several Connected Circumstances, and the Denial in the Replication is taken as a Traverse of Each of the 
Facts stated by Denying the cause which they collectively tend to show.” There is a restriction upon the use of this 
Form, however, where the Opposing Allegations include Matter of Title, Authority, etc., and in such case Matter of 
that Character must be Denied Separately; or, if the plaintiff wishes to disregard these and Deny Other Matters in the 
Plea, such other Matters must be Separately Traversed.78 


General Issues as Double Pleas 

IN some cases the General Issues appear to partake of the Nature of these Cumulative Traverses; for some of 
them are so framed as to convey a Denial, not of any Particular Fact, but Generally of the Whole Matter alleged, as 
Not Guilty in Trespass or Trespass on the Case, and Nil Debet in Debt. And in Assumpsit the defendant is permitted, 
under the General Issue, in that ac~ tion, to avail himself, with some few Exceptions, of any Matter tending to 
disprove his liability. The consequence is, that under these General Issues the defendant has the advantage of 
disputing, and therefore of putting the plaintiff to the Proof of every Averment in the Declaration. Thus, by 
Pleading Not Guilty, in Trespass quare clau.sum fregit, he is enabled to Deny, at the Trial, both that the land was 
the plaintiff's and that he corn-

mitted upon it the trespasses in question, and the plaintiff must establish both these points in evidence. Indeed, 
besides this advantage of Double Denial, the defendant obtains, under the General Issue, in Assumpsit and other 
Actions of Trespass on the Case, the advantage of Double Pleading in Confession and Avoidance. For he is allowed, 
in these actions, to bring forward, upon the General Issue, almost Any Matters, though in the Nature of Confession 
and Avoidance, which tend to disprove his debt or liability; so he is not limited, as he would be in Special Pleading, 
to a reliance on any Single Matter of this description, but may set up any Number of These Defenses. While such is 


Page 506 of 735 


the effect of many of the General Issues in mitigating or evading the Rule against Duplicity, the remark does not 
apply to all. Thus, the general issue of Non Est Factum raises only a Single Question, namely, whether the 
defendant executed a valid and genuine deed, such as is alleged in the Declaration. The defendant may, under this 
Plea, insist that the deed was not executed by him, or that it was executed under circumstances which absolutely 
annul its effect as a deed, but can set up no other kind of Defense.’° 


The Replication Dc Injuria is similar to the General Issue in being a General Traverse, which is allowed where 
an Affirmative Defense is set up by Way of Excuse. Like the General Issue, it is an anomaly and a violation of the 
Rule against Duplicity, since it permits the Party to set up Numerous Defenses by one Plea. 


DUPLICITY—PROTESTATION 


239. A Protestation will not render a Pleading Double. 

THE nature of this illogical and unnecessary Form in Pleading has been heretofore explained, and from its nature 
and object, in being only a collateral objection or reservation, without effect in the Action in which 
it is used, it is manifest that it cannot cause Duplicity. Thus, in the example given on another page, where the 
defendant Pleads the delivery and acceptance of goods in satisfaction of the plaintiff’ s demand, though the plaintiff 
cannot Reply that the goods were neither delivered nor accepted in satisfaction, for this would be Double, yet he 
may Protest that they were not delivered, and at the same time Deny the acceptance, without incurring the objection. 
For a Protestation (as already explained) does not Tend to Issue in the Action, but is made merely to reserve to the 
party the right of Denying or Alleging the Same Matter in a future suit. It consequently cannot fall within the 
object of the Rule against Duplicity, which is, to avoid a Plurality of Issues. 


WHAT DEFENSES MAY BE SHOWN UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE AND WHAT MAY 
OR MUST BE PLEADED SPECIALLY 


240. Defenses which may be shown under the General Issue in the various Actions, and those which may or must be 
Spedally Pleaded are set out in the following Sections. 


IN the succeeding sections each of the actions is analyzed with reference to the defenses which may be shown 
under the general issue and those which may or must be specially pleaded. As will appear, especial attention is given 
to the effect of the Ililary Rules --on these questions.”

IN Trespass, whether to person or property, the General Issue is “Not Guilty.” It operates in the first place as a 
Denial that the defendant committed the Act of Trespass alleged, to wit, the application of force to the plaintiff s 
person, the entry on his land, or the taking or damaging of his goods. It also Denies the plaintiff's Possession, Title, 
or Right of Possession of the Land or Goods.

Under it, therefore, the defendant can show such Matters as directly controvert the fact of his having committed 
the acts complained of.” Matter of Justification and Excuse would admit them, and must therefore be Specially 
Pleaded.*’ In Trespass for Assault and Battery, if the Defense is that the defendant did not assault or beat the 
plaintiff, it will be proper to Plead the General Issue; but if his Defense be of any other description the Plea will be 
inapplicable.*? So, in Trespass Quare Olausuni Fi-egit, or Trespass Dc Bonis Asportatis, if the defendant did not 
in fact break and enter the close in question, or take the goods, the General Issue, “Not Guilty,” will be proper, and it 
will also be applicable if he did break and enter the close, but it was not in the possession of the plaintiff, or not 
lawfully in his possession, as

against the better title of the defendant, or li he did take the goods, but they did riot belong to the plaintiff, for, as the 
Declaration alleges the Trespass to have been committed on the close or goods of the plaintiff, the Plea of Not 
Guilty involves a Denial that the defendant broke and entered or took the close or goods of the plaintiff, and is 
therefore a fit Plea, if the defendant means to contend that the plaintiff had no possession of the close, or property in 
tile goods, sufficient to entitle him to call them his own.® If the Defense is of a’iy other kind, the General Issue will 
not apply; as, for instance, where the defendant intends to show a Justification or Excuse, or a Discharge.*°

THE HILARY RULES—THEIR EFFECT UPON NEGATIVE AND AFFIRMATWE DEFENSES IN 
TRESPASS 


243. Under the Ililary Rules “Not Guilty” operated in trespass quare clausum fregit only as a denial that the 
defendant committed the trespass alleged in the place mentioned; and in trespass de bonis asportatis only as a denial 
of the defendant having committed the trespass alleged by taking or damaging the goods. 


The Hilary Rules of 1834 restricted the Scope of the General Issue by providing that, in Trespass Quare 
Clausurn Fregit, the Plea of Not Guilty shall operate as a Denial that the defendant committed the Trespass 
alleged in the place mentioned, but not as a Denial of the plaintiff s Possession or Right of Possession. If this is 
intended to be Traversed, it must be by a Specific Traverse. 


In Trespass Dc Bonis Asportatis, the Plea of Not Guilty operated under the Hilary Rules as a Denial of the 
defendant having committed the Trespass alleged, by taking or damaging the goods mentioned, but not of 
plaintiff s property therein. To put in Issue the plaintiff's Right, the Specific Trayerse “Not Possessed” was used. 
Prior to these Rules of Court there was no occasion for a Specific Traverse. 
THE GENERAL ISSUE IN TRESPASS 
ON THE CASE 


244. The Plea of “Not Guilty” is the proper General Issue in an Action of Trespass on the Case, and is a Formal 
Denial of Liability, admitting almost All Defenses.

STEPHEN, Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, 278 (2d ed. by Andrews, Chicago 1901). 


THE General Issue in the Action of Trespass on the Case is “Not Guilty,” and the Scope and Effect of this Plea 
is much broader than in the Action of Trespass Vi Fit Armis, where it operates as a Mere Denial or Traverse of the 
Facts alleged. An effect is given it similar to that in the Action of Assumpsit, by which the defendant may contest 
under it, not only the truth of the Material Facts alleged in the Declaration, but may also give in evidence any 
Defense which, as Lord Mansfield observed, “would in equity and conscience, under the existing circumstances, 
preclude the plaintiff from recovering, because the plaintiff must recover upon the 
justice and conscience of his case, and on 
Sec. 244

that only.” -- The defendant, upon the General Issue of Not Guilty, not only put the plaintiff upon the Proof of the 
Whole Charge in the Declaration, including Matters of Inducement, as well as Matters constituting the Gist of the 
Action, but he might also offer evidence of Defenses going to Dispute Liability, more popularly known as 
Affirmative Defenses. And this included Affirmative Defenses in Discharge of the cause of action, as wail as 
Defenses in JustifIcation and Excuse. The net effect of this departure from the True Principles of Pleading, was 
to permit the defendant, under the General Issue, any Matter of Defense in contravention of the Plaintiff’ ’s Right of 
Action, even though such matters were strictly the proper subjects of a Plea in Confession and Avoidance of the 
Declaration; » although the defendant could, if he chose, bring forward by Way of a Special Plea all Matters in 
Confession and Avoidance of the Declaration. Thus, in effect, under the General Issue, the defendant’s Defense 
might be that he did not commit the Wrongful Act complained of, or that

In Trespass on the Case the defendant may, with few exceptions, prove under the General Issue matters in Confession and 
Avoidance. Dnnham v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 85 W.Va. 425, 102 SE. 113 (1920). 


Evidence of a Defense in Justification Is competent under a Plea of the General Issue, though the commencement and ending of the 
Declaration describe the Action as Trespass, provided the body of the Declaration describe an Action in the Nature of an 
Action of Trespass on the Case. George v. Illinois Cent. B. Co., 197 Xil.App. 152 (1015). 

it was Excusable, or that he was Released from its consequences.” This latitude was probably allowed for the same 


Page 512 of 735 


reason that permitted the extended use of the General Issue in Assumpsit, though it is difficult to see how it is 
reconcilable with any o the Principles of Pleading. 


Thus, if your automobile is damaged and you sue the wrongdoer in Trespass, the Plea of Not Guilty will serve as 
a Denial of the Facts stated in the Declaration, and no more. Matters of Justification or Excuse, such as the Defenses 
of Contributory Negligence, or Leave and License, cannot be proved under this Plea. But if you sue in Case, the 
defendant may, under a Plea of Not Guilty, not only put the plaintiff upon Proof of the whole Charge contained in 
the Declaration, but may offer any Defense in Justification or Excuse, or he may set up a Former Recovery, or a 
Release, or Discharge.” An Action on the Case is said ty be in the Nature of a Bill in Equity, and the defendant may 
prove, under the General Issue in that action, almost anything, except the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Libel 
and Slander, which shows that the defendant ought not to recover—an illogical and whimsical reason for slipshod 
Pleading.

PLEAS IN CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE IN TRESPASS ON THE CASE 


245. At Common Law, under a Plea of the General Issue in Trespass on the Case, as in Assumpsit, Debt on 
Simple Contracts, and Trover, most of the Affirmative Defenses may be admitted without being Specially Pleaded. The Two 
Principal Exceptions are the Defenses of the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Libel and Slander. 


In general, all matters in Justification and Excuse, or in Discharge of the alleged Right of Action, could be shown 
under the Gerieral Issue in Case rather than Pleaded Affirmatively in Confession and Avoidance. There were Two 
Principal Exceptions to this Rule, which will be considered shortly—the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Slander 
and Libel Cases.

Limitations could not be given in evidence,” as it spoke of a time past, and related to the time of making the

the Anonymous Case of 1690, declared: “It appears to us that this distinction savors more of ingenious refinement

Statute applying egually to both. If the Statute is not Pleaded, the plaintiff is liable to be surprised, and therefore 
equally unprepared to answer in the one action as in the other. In neither case does the Statute extinguish the debt, but 
Bars only the Remedy, and it is optional whether the defendant will insist upon the Statute or waive it. If he intends 
to insist upon it, he should Plead it, to prevent surprise, and if he does not, it should be presumed he intends to waive 
it. This is the view taken by the late Mr. Serjt. Williams, than whom a sounder lawyer, or more accurate Special 
Pleader has rarely done honor to his profession; and he states it to be very usual, and the Modern Practice, to Plead 
to Debt on Simple Contract, that the Cause of Action did not accrue within six years, that the plaintiff may Reply, 
either that he was within the Exceptions in the Statute, or that he has sued out a Writ within time, as is the 
common ease in Assumpsit,” ~ 


The real reason, however, why the Statute of Limitations must, in general, be Pleaded Specially, stems from 
another cause. Any Allegation which the Pleader is not obliged to Prove as he states is Immaterial. Allegations of 
this character include the specification of time, which in pleading is ordinarily Immaterial, unless the date of a 
transaction is, for some other reason, Material as to its validity. Such Immaterial Allegations are not admitted by 
Demurrer.®” It follows, therefore, that the Statement of a Right which appears, according to the date laid for it, to be 
Barred by the Statute of Limitations, is not, for this very reason, held to be bad on Demurrer, as the plaintiff, in 
Stating his Declaration, is not bound by the Allegation of a Specific Time. Hence, if the defendant desires to take 
advantage of the Bar of the Statute of Limitations, he can

do so only by Pleading the Statute Specially 

—that is, by Averring that the Cause of Action did not accrue to the plaintiff within the period fixed by the Statute. 
Subject to a few Exceptions,’ this was and is the Common-Law Rule. In Equity 2 and at Law,” in a few states, the 
Statute may be reached on Demurrer.

The Common Law Courts felt that to permit the Defense to be shown by the defendant under the General Issue, 
would result in talcing the plaintiff by surprise. It is reported that this Issue was taken up at a meeting of all the 
Judges, called to consider a case involving this Issue which arose in the Court of Common Pleas. At that meeting it 
was determined by a large majority of the Judges that, in the future, evidence of the Defense of Truth of the

Defamatory Matter Charged in the Declaration, should not be admissible under a Plea of the General Issue, but 
should be Pleaded Specially.” 


TIE HILARY RULES—T}IEIH EFFECT UPON AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE DEFENSES IN TRESPASS 
ON THE CASE 


246. In Trespass on the Case, the General Issue of “Not Guilty” under the Runty Rules operated only as a Denial 
of the Breach of Duty or Wrongful Act; all other Deenses were required to be Pleaded Specially. 

THE Scope of the Plea of the General Issue in Trespass on the Case—Not Guilty—was greatly restricted by the 
Hilary Rules of 1834, Section IV, which provided that “the Plea of Not Guilty shall operate as a denial only of the 
breach of the duty or wrongful act alleged to have been committed by the defendant, and not of the facts stated in 
the Inducement; and no other defense than such denial shall be admissible under that Plea; all other Pleas in denial 
shall take issue on some particular matter of fact alleged in the Declaration.” The term “Inducement”, as used 
therein, refers to those Facts and Circumstances which are required to be Stated in an Action of Trespass on the 
Case, in order to disclose the plaintiff s Right as it existed

at the time of the defendant’s Wrongful Act. The Plea of the General Issue, after the fluary Rules, operated to Deny 
the Wrongful Act of the defendant, and to admit the Inducement, which disclosed the plaintiff s Right. 


Under Section TV of the Hulary Rules all Matters in Confession and Avoidance were required to be Pleaded 
Specially, as in Actions of Assurnpsit. The Defenses of the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Defamation were 
required to be so Pleaded even before the Hilary Rules, as we have previously observed. 


THE GENERAL ISSUE IN TROVER 


247. The General Issue in Trover, as in 
Trespass and Trespass on the Case, is “Not 
Guilty,” which is a Formal Denial of the 
Wrongful Conversion. It denies a Legal Conclusion, and so Admits All Defenses, except 
Release and the Statute of Limitations.

Any Defense may be shown, whether going to Dispute a Material Allegation in the Plaintiff s Declaration, or going 
to Dispute Liability. Thus, such a Defense as the Bankniptcy of the defendant, may be shown, but neither a Release 
nor the Bar of the Statute of Limitations may be admitted.’ This latitude is permissive only, however, and the de- 
fendant is at liberty to Plead Specially any Defense which admits both the property in the plaintiff and the 
conversion, but Justifies the latter.*

THE HILARY RULES—THEIR EFFECT UPON NEGATIVE AND AFFIRMATIVE

AS Trover was in Form an Action on the Case, it fell within the Scope of Section IV of the Hulary Rules. Under 
the Reforming Rule, the Plea of the General Issue operated to Deny the Wrongful Act of the defendant, and no 
longer, as at Common Law, Denied the Right in the plaintiff, even though the Facts of Right might, in some degree, 
constitute a part of the description of the Wrongful Acts.° In the examples which the authors of the Hilary Rules 
gave under Section IV, in Paragraph 3, with respect to the Operation of the Rule as to the General Issue in Trover, it 
was said that “in an action for converting the plaintiff s goods, the conversion only, and not the plaintiff’ s title to the 
goods,” were in issue under the Plea. 


According to Chitty 10 and Greenleaf,” only the Conversion in Fact, was in issue, irrespective of its character. 
Martin, however, states that the decisions have receded from this view, and that the term “Converskm/’ as used in 
the Rules, means a Wrongful Conversion, in the same sense as it did Prior to the Rules, and that there can be no such 
thung as a Justifiable Conversion.” 


After the Hilary Rules, under a Plea of the General Issue in Trover, a defendant was permitted to prove any 
Defense tending to show that the Act complained of was not Wrongful, and hence not a Conversion, and, of course, 


Page 517 of 735

in the action, to be true.” Evidence of a lien cannot be shown under this Plea,” as it questions the plaintiff s 
possession or right of possession, which stands admitted by the Plea; -if this Allegation is to be placed in Issue, in 
England, after 1834, it must be done by a Specific Traverse. After the Hilary Rules, in England, the Scope of the 
General Issue was greatly restricted, being limited to a Denial of the Wrongful Act of Conversion, hence most 
Defenses had thereafter to be Pleaded Specially.’ If the plaintiff's title was to be put in Issue, the defendant was 
required to interpose a Specific Traverse of “Not Possessed.” 


In general, it has usually been said, that in the Several States of the United States, the Rules as they existed in 
England prior to 1834, or at Common Law, are followed. 


TUE GENERAL ISSUE IN EJECTMENT 


250. The General Issue in Ejeetment is “Not Guilty,’ which permits all Defenses, Affirmative as well as 
Negative, to be shown. Equitable Defenses are still not allowed in sonic jurisdictions.

IN view of the fact that Ejectment originated as a Personal Action in which the lessee sued for Damages for 
Ouster from his Term, the Plea of the General Issue constituted a General Traverse as in other forms of Trespass 
Actions, It thus operated to place in Issue all the Material Allegations stated in the Declaration, that is, the Right to 
Let, the Entry, the Actual Lease, and the Ouster. But in time the Scope of “Not Guilty” was restricted by the 
Common Consent Rule, under which the Actual Tenant, as a condition of being substituted in place of the Casual 
Ejector, was compelled to admit the Entry, the Lease and the Ouster, leaving in Issue only Title. 


As a result of the development of the Action, the General Issue in Ejectment—’Not Guilty’”—operates as 
follows: (1) As a Denial of the Unlawfulness of the withholding, that is, of the Plaintiff's Title and Right to 
Possession; (2) All Defenses in Excuse or Discharge, including the Statute of Limitations, are available."

251. In Ejectment, as Affirmative Defenses are admissible under the General Issue, it is not proper to Plead them 
Specially. Equitable Defenses are not allowed in Ejectment. 


AFFIRMATIVE Defenses are wholly improper in Ejectment, as these Matters are available under the General 
Issue,’° nor are Equitable Defenses 20 permitted in Ejectment. It constitutes no Defense in Ejectment that the deed of 
the plaintiff was secured by fraud going to the consideration, as contrast

ed to fraud in the execution, although a Court of Equity might rescind the conveyance.” 


At Common Law, it took a Legal Title to maintain or defeat an Action of Ejectment. It follows, therefore, that an 
Equitable Defense constituted no Bar to a recovery. Thus, it is no Defense in Ejectment to show that a deed was 
procured by the plaintiff's fraud, even though a Court of Equity, on the same showing, might rescind the 
conveyanceYz Possession of land under a verbal contract, payment of the price, and the making of valuable 
improvements thereon, will operate to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds in Equity, hut not in a Court of Law, 
and such facts constitute no Defense to an Action of Ejectnient. The defendant, for relief, must have recourse to a 
separate proceeding in Equity.” - 


In Illinois, when the distinction between the Common Law and Chancery Courts was being maintained, it was 
not permissible, in an Action of Ejectment, to attack a deed upon the ground that the grantor was mentally 
incompetent to execute the deed, as the remedy in such case is in a Court of Equity. 


In those states, in which the distinction between Common Law and Equity Jurisdiction is not so strictly 
maintained, the Defense of Incompetency can be raised in an Action of Ejectment.” In an Ejectment Action, the 
Court cannot adjust the equities, if any, be-

them at the place mentioned in the Declaration.** Thus, the Sole Issue raised is whether the defendant seized the 
goods at all, or at the place stated. It follows, therefore, that the Traverse is clearly

Where the Declaration is for the unlawful detention only, the Plea in Denial should be “Non Detinet” or “Non Detinuit ;« and that would seem 


on principle to be the Proper Plea at the present time, unless in case of an actual wrongful taking, since the gist of the Action is now the 
Wnngful Detention. Bourk v, Riggs, 38 II. 321 (1865); Chandler -cc Lincoln, 52 Ill. 14 (1869).

in the Nature of a Specific Traverse, and hence should be so classified.” 


The Effect of the Statutory Merger of Detmug and Replevin Upon the General Is-sue in Replevin 

WHEN the Wrongful Act of the defendant consists only of a Wrongful Detention, after a Lawful Taking, and 
Replevin is allowed by Statute, “Non Detinet” becomes the General Issue as in Detinue; but the effect of this Plea is 
no greater than that of “Non Cepit,” and, therefore, if the defendant wishes to Deny the Plaintiff’ s Property, he must 
allege an Adverse Title in himself, or some one under whom he claims. The Pleas of “Non Cepit’ and “Non 
Detinet” thus both concede the Right of Possession to be in the Plaintiff, and only put in Issue the Taking and the 
Detention, as the case may be.” 


By Statute, in Some States, a Plea of “Not Guilty” or other General Issue, is allowed to put in Issue, not only the 
Wrongful Taking and Detention, but also the Right of the Plaintiff to the Possession of the property claimed, and 
even Matters in Excuse may be admissible under it.” 


THE SPECIAL TRAVERSE IN REPLEVIN 


256. The Denial of the Right or Title of the Plaintiff is commonly made by a Peculiar Argumentative Species of 


Page 523 of 735 


Denial, known as 
a Special Traverse. 


35. Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. XI, Defences in Bar by V/ny of Traverse, Art. II, Gem cml Traverse, § 268, Replevin, 229 (St. 
Paul, 1905).

Illinois: Van Namee v. Bradley, 09 Ill. 299 (1873). 


37. Florida: flolliday v. EcKinne, 22 Fla. 153 (1886); 
Mississippi: Bennett v. Holioway, 55 Miss. 211 
(1877). 


The General Denial in Beplevin under the Codes has a peculiar comprehensiveness and permits almost all Defenses, Affirmative as well as 
Negative. Note: 
Pleading—Bep)evin—--.Wbat Defenses are Provable Under a General Denial, $ Minn.L.Rev. 563 (1021); Squire, General Denial in Replevin, 


24 Case & Cornmonl 21 (1017). 

A SPECIAL Traverse is the proper Form of Denial of the Right or Title of the Plaintiff in an Action of Replevin. It 
consists of two parts: (1) An Affirmative Statement by Way of Inducement, setting up the facts and circumstances 
inconsistent with the Right or Title of the Plaintiff, such as Title in the Defendant or in a Third Person; (2) An Abs 
que Hoc Cause follows this Argumentative Denial with a Direct Denial of the Plaintiff’ s Right.” Thus, to illustrate, 
suppose the plaintiff in Replevin alleges that the defendant Wrongfully took his cattle. The defendant, Pleading an 
Affirmative Statement by Way of Inducement, would allege “that the cattle were the cattle of X, a stranger.” But 
Two Affirmatives do not create an Issue. If, therefore, the defendant ended his Plea at this point, it would be subject 
to a Special Demurrer as an Argumentative Denial. To avoid this, the defendant adds his Absqw3 Hoc Clause—and 
not the cattle of the plaintiff—which turns the Argumentative Denial into a Negative Plea Denying Title.*° 


Under a Plea by Way of Special Traverse, the plaintiff had the burden of Proof, and the defendant, if he succeeds, 
is entitled to a return of the goods, without the necessity of making an Avowry or Cognizance, because the plaintiff 
must recover on the strength of his own title and right to immediate possession.

FLEAS IN CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE 
IN REPLEVIN 


237. Affirmative Defenses must be Specially 
Pleaded. An Avowry or Cognizance is a Plea somewhat in the nature of a Cross-Action by the defendant. 

MATTER in Justification and Excuse for the taking, such as Levy on Execution or Attachment, or on Distress, or 
Seizure for Taxes, must be Specially Pleaded,” as also the Statute of Limitations, Satisfaction or Release,” and 
Estoppel to claim the goods.” 


Where the defendant desired to Justify his taking as landlord, or on behalf of someone else from whom he 


derived his right to distrain, he Pleaded what was known as an Avowry, which justified the taking of the goods in his 
own right, or Cognizance, under which he claimed the goods or chattels in the right or on behalf of another. The 


Page 524 of 735 


usual grounds were the taking on Distress Warrant for rent in arrear, or taking under Legal Process,” Such Fleas 
avowed or acknowledged the seizure of the goods or chattels in question, and set forth the facts of a tenancy and of 
arrearage in rent, and Concluded by demanding a return of the seized property. The Avowry or Cognizance thus 
admits that the plaintiff is the owner of the goods, and alleges a right to take or detain them as security for the rent 
alleged to be due. Such a Plea was in the raLure of a Cross-Declaration, and hence the

plaintiff s Next Plea was not a Replication but a Plea in Bar, after which followed the Replication, Rejoinder, etc., 
the ordinary name of each Stage of Pleading being thus postponed one step further than in an ordinary action. In 
Pleading thereto, the plaintiff invoked the Plea of Rien.s en Arrere (nothing in arrear), which was recognized as the 
General Traverse for rent due on a demise.” ‘This Plea, entered at what was usually the Replication Stage of 
Pleading, and in Form more like a Specific than a General Traverse, was restricted in Scope, admitting the 
defendant's title as stated in the Avowry, and operating only to Deny that any rent was in arrear.*° 


The Hilary Rules in no way changed the Scope of the So-called General Issue in Replevin, as in Form it was 
already in the Nature of a Specific Traverse. As has been observed, “Non Cepit,” the General Issue, operated only 
to Deny the taking in the place mentioned; it did not operate to put in issue title, and hence the development of the 
Special Traverse, discussed in a preceding section, to accomplish that end when desired. 


TIE GENERAL ISSUE IN DEBT ON SIMPLE CONTRACTS AND 
STATUTES 


258. The proper General Issue in Debt on Simple Contracts or on Statutes is “Nil Debet,” which is a Formal 
denial of the Debt. It Not only Denies the existence of any contract, but under it Defenses in Excuse or in Discharge 
may also be shown.

WHERE the Action of Debt is not founded on a Record or a Specialty, the General Form of Traverse is “Nil 
Debet,” meaning that the defendant owes nothing; and it applies without regard to whether the debt arises by the 
operation of a Statute or by Simple Contract. As “Nil Debet” denied a present existing debt, the Courts gave a very 
broad construction to it, permitting Defenses which went to show the non-existence of the debt. Thus, for example, 
where the Declaration 
in Debt on Simple Contract alleged that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff for goods sold and delivered, to 
which the defendant pleaded “Nil Debet”, that is, that “he does not owe the money alleged to be due,” the Issue on 
the Pleadings, framed in the present tense, is: Is the defendant presently indebted to the plaintiff? Were the 
Allegation merely “that the goods were not sold and delivered,” it would, of course, be applicable to no case but one 
where the defendant intends to deny the sale and delivery; but, as the Allegation is that he does not owe, it is evident 
that the Plea is adapted to any kind of Defense that tends to deny an existing debt, and, therefore, not merely, in the 
case supposed, to a Defense consisting of a Denial of the sale and delivery, but also to the Defenses of Arbitrament, 
Satisfaction, Release, and a multitude of others, to which a Traverse of a narrower kind would be inapplicable.” It 
has been said that the Defenses of Bankruptcy, the Statute of Limitations and Tender are the only ones which could 
not be proved under the Plea of Nil Debet. However this may be, it appears that there is hardly any Matter of 
Defense to an Action of Debt to which the Plea of “Nil Debet” is not applicable, because almost all Defenses resolve 
themselves into a Denial of the Debt.” The Scope of the

In Debt on a Penal Statute, the more appropriate Traverse is that of “Nil Debet,” as it accords with the Form of 
the Action. However, the Plea of “Not Guilty” may be interposed, because the action is to enforce the penalty for an 
offense.’°

necessary to Plead Specially, most Defenses in Debt might be shown under “Nil Delict,” whether going to the Denial of 
a Material Allegation or to Dispute Liability. 


AS previously observed, it was said that the Scope of “Nil Debet” was so broad, that the only Defenses which 
had to be Pleaded Affirmatively were Bankruptcy, the Statute of Limitations and Tender.”

THE IHLARY RULES—THEIR EFFECT UPON THE SCOPE OF THE GENERAL ISSUE IN DEBT ON 


SIMPLE CONTRACTS 
AND STATUTES 


260. The Rilary Rules changed the General Issue in Debt from “Nil Delict” [1 do not owe] to “Nunqiiam 
Indehitatus” U never did owej, in Actions of Debt on Simple Contracts other than Bills of E~cchange and Promissory 
Notes, and hence, as in Inclebitatus Assumpsit after the Hilary Rules, all Matters in Confession and Avoidance are to be 
Specially Pleaded. 


The Hilary Rules abolished the Flea of “Nil Debet.” s: The Plea “Nunquam Indebitatus” was substituted in lieu 
thereof in all Actions on Simple Contracts, other than Bills of Ex 
change and Promissory Notes. 
The same ef 
feet was given to this New Form of Flea as to the Plea of “Non Assumpsit” in Indehitatus Assumpsit under the 
Hilary Rules, and all Matters in Confession and Avoidance were to be Specially Pleaded as in the Action of Assump 
sit. 


In other Actions of Debt in which the General Issue of “Nil Debet” had been used, in-eluding those on Bills of 
Exchange and 


as of Assumpsit, the same reason to,’ Pleading the Statute applyi’,g equally to both. If the Statute is not pleaded, the piaintift is liable t be 
surprised, and therefore equally unprepared to answer in the One Action as jo the Other, In neither ease does the Statute extinguish the Debt, 
but Bars only the I ti’ ,nedv, and it is optional whether the defendant will insist upon the Statute or waive it. I- he intends to insist upon it, he 
should plead it to prevent surprise, and if he does not, it should be presu med lie intends to waive it. Phi is is the view taken by the late Mr. 
Serjt. Williams, than whom a sounder Lawyer, or more accurate pleader has rarely (lone honor te his profession ; and he states It to be very 
usual, and the modern practice, to plead to debt on Simple Contract, that the Cause of Action did not accrue within six years, that the plaintiff 
may reply, either that be was within any of the exceptions in the Statute, or that he has sued out a Writ within time, as is the Common Case in 
Assutupsit.”

THE Plea of “Nul Tiel Record” (no such record) attacks the existence of the obligation alleged; and under it, it 
may be shown that no such Record exists as is alleged, which is generally done by establishing its invalidity as a 
Judgment, or advantage may be taken of a Variance in stating it.~’ As it

is a Maxim of Law that there can be no Averment in Pleading against the Validity of a Record, though there may be 
against its operation, no Matter of Defense can be Pleaded which existed anterior to the recovery of the Judgment; — 
and, as this Plea merely puts in Issue the existence of the Record as stated, any Matter of Discharge, such, for 
example, as a Release, must be Specially Pleaded. 


“Nul Tiel Record” sets up the Defense either: (1) that there is no such Record at all in existence, or (2) a 
Variance, the Record being Different from that Declared on by the Plaintiff, or (3) that the Judgment is Void on the 
Face of the Record. All other Defenses

specifically put in Issue by the Pleading or on the face of the record. “In Debt or Scire Fncias on a Judgment or Recognizance, the General 
Issue is Nul Tleh Record, which may be properly pleaded, where there is either no record at all, or one different from that which the plaintiff

STEPHEN, Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions 276, 277 (2d ed. by Andrews, Chicago, 1901). 


THE Plea of “Non Est Factum” in Covenant only puts the execution and validity of the deed in Issue in the same 
manner as in Debt on Specialty, and admits the same Proof only?* Such a Plea is not a true General Issue, as it only 
puts the deed in Issue, and not the Breach of the Covenant. Most Defenses in Covenant must, therefore, be by Spe- 
cific Traverse, or a Speciai Plea, when statutes do not provide otherwise. In this action, however, the defendant 
could give in evidence, under a Plea of “Non EstFactum,” that the deed declared on was delivered as an escrow, on a 
condition not performed; or that it was Void at Common Law ab initio, as being made by a married woman, or 
lunatic, and the like; or that it afterwards became Void by alteration, cancellation or erasure. 


Where, therefore, the defendant Pleads “Non Est Factum” to a Declaration, only the deed is placed in Issue, and 


Page 531 of 735 


all other Facts stand admitted by the defendant’s failure to Deny them by an appropriate Plea.°° 


The Plea of “Non Est Factum” in Covenant, as developed at Common Law, is restricted in Scope when compared 
with the General Issue in Assumpsit, Case or Debt on Simple Contract, confining the Issue to

the Existence of the Deed in Fact and in Law, All Other Defenses being required to be Specially Pleaded,”° 
Saunders 67 and Chitty ~ felt that the Plea lacked the requisites of a General Traverse, as it is so narrow in Scope. 
The reason for this characteristic of the Plea—its narrowness—may be traced to the fact that in ancient times there 
was no Defense to a Sealed Contract outside of its conditions, except such as had a logical tendency to show that it 
had not been executed, or that the cause had been released under seal. Thus, in the early period of the action, Fraud, 
Want of Consideration, and Release, unless under Seal, constituted No Defense. No Defense in Pais outside of 
Non-Performance of conditions, except Duress, would be entertained.” 


In an Action on a Sealed Contract of Lease, if you sue in Covenant for the rent, the defendant must Plead to some 
Particular Allegation. The Defendant may plead Non Est Factum, yet that only puts the Execution or Validity of the 
deed in Issue, and not the Breach of the Covenant. If, however, you sue in Debt on the Lease, though it be Sealed, 
the defendant can Plead the General Issue of Nil Debet, as the Specialty is considered as but the Inducement to the 
action. In Actions of Debt on the Specialty itself, the General Issue is Non Est Factum, as in Covenant. Under Nil 
Debet, the defendant may not only put the plaintiff to the necessity of showing the existence of a legal contract, but 
he may give in evidence the Performance of it, or Matter in Excuse of Performance, or a Re

267. Matters showing that the Deed was merely Voidable, Not loid, such as Duress, Fraud in the Inducement, 
Gaming, Infancy and Usury, were required to be Pleaded Specially. 


IT was an Inflexible Rule that in actions on deeds, Special Matters showing that the instrurnent was merely 
Voidable, Not Void, such as Duress, Fraud in the Inducement, Gaming, Infancy and Usury, were required to be 
Pleaded Specially, ' when, in the course of time, they came to be recognized as Valid Defenses at Law.” 


In referring to the late recognition of some Defenses, as Legal Defenses, Martin declares: 
“It may be proper to mention in this connection that under the Common Law, as prevailing down to very recent 
times, Fraud was no Defense at Law to an Action on a Sealed InstrumenW' The same is true of the Defense

General Issue in some of the other Common Law Actions, such, for example, as Assumpsit or Case, tke effect of the

WHERE the action is in Special Assumpsit, the General Issue of “Non Assumpsit” is a Denial of the Contract as

Under it, any Proof is proper showing that no such Contract as is stated was in fact made; ~ that the Statement of the

defendant is not the Agreement Pleaded; or that he made No Promise at all.” 


In the case of Renes v, Rankers’ Life Ma Co.,*’ the Bhinois Supreme Court states the Scope of the General Issue 
in Assumpsit as follows: “It is well settled that nearly every Defense is Admissible, under the General Issue or Plea 
of Non Assumpsit, which shows that there was not a subsisting cause of action in the plaintiff at the time the suit 
was brought. A bankrupt or insolvent’s Discharge and the Statute of Limitations are among the very few Exceptions 
to this Rule. Under such General Issue, the defendant may put in Issue the plaintiff's Capacity to Sue, the Execution 
of the Contract, and the Release and Satisfaction and Payment of the debt, if made previous to the Commencement 


of the Suit, 2 R.CL. § 28, p. 770. Whatever Matter of Defense was contained in the Special Plea, which plaintiff was

Tidd states the Scope of the General Issue in Assumpsit as follows; ~ “In Assumpsit, we have seen, the General 
Issue, or Common Plea in Denial, is Non Assumpsit: and this Plea was formerly holden to be proper, when there was 
either no contract between the parties, or not such a contract as the plaintiff had declared on; and the defendant 
might have given in evidence under it, that the contract was Void in Law, by Coverture (James v. Fowkes, 12 
Mod. 101), Gaming (Hussey v~ Jacob, 1 Ld- Raym. 87), Usury (Ld. Bernard v. Saul, | Strange, 498), etc., or 


Voidable by Infancy (Darby v. Boucher, | Salk. 279; Madox v. Eden, | Bos. & P.481, {a] ), Duress, etc.; or, if 

good in Point of Law, that it had been Performed (Brown v. Cornish, | Ld. Baym. 217; Paramore v. Johnson, I Ld. 

Raym. 566, 12 Mod. 376; Sea v. Taylor, 1

Salk. 394), or that there was sonic Legal Excuse for its Non-Performance, as a Release, or Discharge before Breach, 
or Non-Performance by the Plaintiff of a Condition Precedent, etc. This sort of evidence was calculated to show that 
the plaintiff never had a cause of action: but if he had, the defendant might have given in evidence under the General 
Issue, that it was Discharged by an Accord and Satisfaction (Paraniore v. Johnson, 1 Ld. Raym. 586, 12 Mod. 376; 
Martin v. Thornton, 4 Esp. Rep. 151, per Ld. Alvanley, C. 3.; but see Adderley v. Evans, 1 Ken. 250; Roades v.

boni v. Kirkman, 1 Meeson. & W. 418, 1 Tyr. & C. 777. S.C.), Arbitrament, Release, Foreign Attachment, or 
Former Recovery for the Same Cause, etc.: In short, the question in Assumpsit, upon the General Issue, was whether 
there was a subsisting debt or cause of action, at the time of Commencing the Suit. But Matter of Defence arising 
after action brought could not have been Pleaded in Bar of the action generally; ~ and therefore was not admissible 
in evidence under the General Issue; and Matters of Law in Avoidance of the Contract, or Discharge of the Action, 
were usual’y Pleaded. It was also necessary to Plead a Tender, or the Statute of Limitations, etc., and to Plead or 
give a Notice of Set-off. Anciently, Matters in Discharge of the Action must have been Pleaded Specially. Afterwards, a

270. Matters of Defense arising alter the Commencement of the Action were required to he Pleaded Specially; 
and Matters of Law in Avoidance of the Contract, or in Discharge of the Action, were usually Specially Pleaded. It was 
necessary to Plead Bankruptcy, Tender, the Statute of Limitations, and Set-Off. 


AS we have seen, the General Rule in Special Assunipsit was that any Defense which went to show there was no 
subsisting cause of action at the time of the Commencement of the Action, could be shown under the General Issue. 
But Defenses arising after the action had Commenced were not Pleadable in Bar of the action generally, and hence 
were not admissible in evidence under the General Issue. Matters of Law in Avoidance of the Contract, or in 
Discharge of the Action, were usually pleaded.* It was necessary to Plead Bankruptcy, the Statute of Frauds,*° the

sory Notes, Want of Consideration, Total an Partial Failure of Consideration, and Fraut either in the Execution or in 
the Considers tion, were required to be Pleaded Speciall3 Former recovery might be shown under th General 
Issue.°° 


Some doubt has been raised as to whethe: 
the Defense of the Statute of Frauds could b availed of under the General Issue. The Gen eral Rule, if a party would 
avail himself ol the Statute of Frauds as a Defense, is that he must Plead it. The reason for the Rule at Common Law 
appears obvious, for a Contract is not Absolutely Void, but merely Voidable at the Election of the Party against 
whom it is to be enforced. When, therefore, such a Contract is declared upon, if a Party fails to Plead the Statute of 
Frauds, he will be deemed to have waived it! 


THE RILARY RULES—THEIR EFFECT ON THE SCOPE OF TIIE GENERAL ISSUE 
IN SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT 


271. The Ililary Rules restricted the General Issue in Special Assumpsit to a Denial in Fact of the Promise or Contract 
Alleged. 

ANCIENTLY, as we have seen, Matters in Discharge of the Action were required to be Specially Pleaded. 
Afterward, a distinction was made between Express and Implied Assurnpsit; in the former, or in Special Assunipsit, 
they were still required to be Pleaded, but not in the latter—General or Indebitatus Assumpsit. At length, about the 
time of Lord Holt there was a general relaxation of the earlier view, arid they were

universally allowed to be given in evidence under the General Issue in either Form of Action. 

Thereafter, 
declared that “in all Actions of Assumpsit, except on Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes, the Plea of Non- 
Assumpsit shall operate only as a denial in fact of the express contract or promise alleged, or of the matters of fact 
from which the contract or promise alleged may be implied in law.” Thus, if the defendant be charged with an 
Express Promise, and his case be that, alter making such Promise, it was Released, this plainly Confesses and 
Avoids the Declaration. To permit the defendant, therefore, to give this in evidence under the General Issue, which is 
a Plea by Way of Traverse, is to lose sight of the distinction between the Two Kinds of Pleading. 


Under the Hilary Rules, this misapplication and abuse of the General Issue was corrected. It restricted “Non Assumpsit” to a 
Denial of the Contract alleged. It did not Deny the Breach,” nor Performance by the plaintiff of a Condition Precedent to his 
Right to sue, nor Performance by him of a Bilateral contract. These were, under the Hilary Rules, properly the subject 
of a Common or Specific Traverse. 


In Actions on Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes, under the Hilary Rules, the General Issue was not 
permitted. What was required was a Specific Traverse of some Matter of Fact alleged in the Declaration, such as 
making, drawing, indorsing, accepting, presenting or giving notice.

The Scope of the Genera? issue in Gnwral or Indebitatus Assumpsit 


THE General Issue in the Action of General Assumpsit is “Non-Assumpsit”. This Plea operates similarly to the 
General Issue in Special Assumpsit and in Debt on Simple Contract, but with certain peculiarities. It is, in the first 
place, a Denial of the indebtedness and of all the Matters of Fact from which the Debt and the Promise alleged may 


Page 537 of 735 


be Implied by Law, such as the bargain, sale and delivery, the performance of work, or the receipt of money to 
the use of the plaintiff. Defenses in Excuse and in Discharge may, for the most part, be shown under the General Issue. 
Many matters in Discharge need

273. While many Matters in Discharge may 
be shown under the General Issue in General or 
Indebitatus Assumpsit, some Defenses, such as 
Discharge in Bankruptcy, and the Statute of 
Limitations, must be Specially Pleaded. 


MANY matters in Discharge, such as Payment, Novation, Accord and Satisfaction, Conditions Subsequent, may 
be shown under the General Issue, with some exceptions, among which are the following: (1) Discharge in 
Bankruptcy; (2) Failure and Lack of Consideration of Negotiable Notes, if copy is filed with the Common Counts; °- 
(3) Infancy (query); (4) Set-Off; ~ (5) Statute of Limitations; and (6) Usury. 


THE WILARY RULES—TIIEIR EFFECT 
UPON THE SCOPE OF THE GENERAL

ASSUMPSIT 


274. Under the Hilary Rules “Non Assumpsit”, in General or Indehitatus Assurnpsit, oper. ated as a Denial of the 
Matters of Fact from which the Contract or Promise alleged may be Implied by Law. 


BY the Hilarv Rules of 1834, it was provided that “Non Assumpsit”, in General Assunipsit, shall operate only as 
Denial of the Matters of Fact from which the Contract or Promise alleged may be Implied in Law.

it the Common Counts alone are used, the defendant has no notice describing the instrument relied upon for a recovery, and accordingly, It is 
held that the defendant cannot be required to set up Defenses such as the Statute of Frauds specially. 

$6. Kennard v. Secor, 57 WLApp. 415 (1804). 

And hi compliance with this Rule, it was declared that in General Assumpsit for goods sold and delivered, or for 

money had and received, “Non Assuinpsit” was to operate only as a Denial of the sale and delivery, or of the receipt 

of the money to the plaintiff’ s use. 


In consequence of the Hilary Rules, in General Assumpsit, as in Special Assumpsit, all Matters in Confession and 
Avoidance, not only those in Discharge, but those which show the transaction to be either Void or Voidable in Point 


Page 538 of 735 


of Law, on the ground of Fraud or otherwise, were required to be Specially Pleaded. 
COMPARISON OF SCOPE OF DIFFERENT GENERAL ISSUES 


275. The General Issue has a wide Scope in Case, Trover, Assumpsit, Debt on Simple Contract, and Ejeetment. It has 
the effect of a General Denial only in Trespass and Detinue. In other Actions, the General Issue is more in the nature of a 
Specific Denial than a General Denial. 


IT has been observed that, at Common Law, by the General Issue in Assumpsit, in Debt on Simple Contract, in 
Trover, in Case, and in Ejeetment, the defendant puts the plaintiff to the Proof of almost all the elements of his cause 
of action, and at the same time he may prove in his own Defense almost all Matters in Justification and Excuse, and 
most of the matters in Discharge. In Trespass and Detinue, however, the General Issue is only a Summary Denial of 
the Material Allegations of the Declaration, and matters in Confession and Avoidance must be Specially Pleaded, 
and cannot be admitted under the General Issue. 


In the Actions of Covenant, Debt on Specialty, Debt on Judgment, and Replevin, the General Issue does not 
perform the function of a General Denial, but rather has the effect of denying only some of the Material Allegalions 
in the Declaration, therefore, in truth, partaking of the characteristics of a Specific Traverse, rather than a General 
Traverse; 

Sec. 277 
PLEAS—PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 
513 
and, in these instances, matters in Confession and Avoidance must be Specially Pleaded, and cannot be admitted 
under the General Issue. 


By the FRIary Rules of 1834, promulgated in England under Stat. 3 and 4 Wm. IV, c. 42, the Scope of the 
General Issue, as it existed at Common Law, in admitting almost every possible Defense in certain actions, was lim- 
ited. The particular object of these Rules was to generally limit, in England, the operation or Scope of the General 
Issue in actions upon Contracts, to a Direct Denial of the Contract, and in Actions for Wrongs, to a Denial only of 
the Breach of Duty or Wrongful Act of the defendant, making the defendant Specifically Traverse or Deny any other 
Material Fact stated in the Declaration, and Plead Affirmatively all Matters in Confession and Avoidance. 


NOTICE OF DEFENSES UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE 


276. Statutes sometimes have permitted the setting up of matter in Confession and Avoidance without a Special Plea at 
the option of the Pleader, by giving Notice in Writing under the General Issue of the Special Matters intended to be 
relied on for Defense at the Trial. 


INSTEAD of developing the Rules of Pleading in the direction of substituting Specific Pleas for General 
Traverses, as was done in England under the FRIary Rules of 1834, the Common-Law Procedure Act of 1852, and 
later Acts, some American states have gone in the opposite direction. Statutes sometimes have permitted the setting 
up of matter in Confession and Avoidance without a Special Plea at the option of the Pleader, by giving Notice in 
Writing under the General Issue of the Special Matters intended to be relied on for Defense at the Trial,” 


No Issue of Fact or of Law can be raised on a Notice of Special Matter of Defense 

filed with the General IssueP* This Rule was criticized as follows by the Illinois Supreme Court in the case of Hunt 
v. Weir.” “Treating the Notice as a Plea, and open to Demurrer, these consequences would be avoided. If a 
Demurrer be sustained to the Notice, the defendant can Amend it as he can a Defective Special Plea, and he is in no 
danger of being caught in a trap, which, though he may have set himself by his Defective Notice, need not, to 
advance justice, be suddenly sprung upon him on the Trial of the cause. The quality of the notice is a preliminary 
matter, and should be determined before the Trial. Like objections to Depositions, they are heard and disposed of 
before the Trial, and cannot be started for the first time on the Trial.’’ 1 


PLEA PUIS DARREIN CONTINUANCE 


277. A Plea Puis Darrein Continuance is a Plea by the defendant of Matter of Defense which has arisen since the last 


Page 539 of 735 


Continuance of the cause. 
Such a Plea waives and supersedes all former Pleas. 


UNDER the Ancient Law, there were Continuances or Adjournments of the proceedings for certain purposes 
from One Day or one Term to another; and in such cases there was an Entry made on the Record expressing the 
ground of the Adjournment, and appointing a day for the parties to reappear. In the intervals between such 
Continuances and the Day appointed, the Parties were out of Court, and therefore not in a situation to Plead. But it 
sometimes happened that after a Plea had been Pleaded, and while the Parties were out of court, in consequence of 
such a Continuance, a New Matter of Defense arose,

which did not exist, and which the defendant had consequently no opportunity to Plead, before the Last

Defenses arising after the action has been 

begun cannot, as a Rule, be shown under the General Issue, for the reason that they do not Deny that a cause of

of the action,” or, if they do not arise until after Plea, they must be Pleaded ‘Puis Darrein Continuance.” ~ But in the

Thus, payment of a debt sued for or a Release or Compromise, or another Judgment for the same cause, etc., since the suit was commenced, 
cannot be Pleaded Generally In Bar. If the Defense has arisen since the Plea or Issue joined, it must be set up by a Flea of Pals Darrein

“The General Rule upon this subject at Common Law 


Page 540 of 735 


Is, that any Matter of Defense arising after the 

Commencement of the Suit, cannot be Pleaded in 

Ear of tbe Action generally. If such matter arise 
on the Case an Exception to this Rule exists, and such Defenses as a Release Executed after Suit Begun and Issue 
Joined may be shown under the General Issue, and it is not necessary that they be Pleaded Puis Darrein 
Continuance.” 


The Plea Puis Darrein Continuance may be either in Abatement or in Bar, like other Pleas, according to the 
Matter. It must be certain and definite in every particular, the greatest degree of strictness being required.® 


A Plea Puis Darrein Continuance is a waiver of and substitute for the first Plea, and of the latter no advantage can 
be taken afterwards. When flied, the Plea, by operation of Law, supersedes all other Defenses in the cause, and the 
Parties proceed to settle 


after thc Commencement of the Suit and Before Plea, It must be pleaded to the further maintenance of the Action. But if it arise After Flea, 
and Before Replication, or After Issue joined, whether of Law or Fact, then it must be pleaded Puis Dan-elm Cost innonce. A Plea of this kind 
involves great legal consequences that do not attach to an Ordinary Plea. It only questions the plaintiff’s right to /5-i-the,’ i,soj.,ttaj,t the Suit. 
When filed, it, In’ Operation of Law, supersedes all other Pleas and Defenses in the Cause, and the parties proceed to settle the Pleading fle 
Novo, jast as though no Plea or Pleas had theretofore been filed in the ease. By reason of Pleas of this kind having a tendency to delay, great 
strictness is required in framing them. In this respect they are viewed much like Pleas in Abatement, and, for the same reason, they must, 
like those Pleas, he verified by Affidavit.” Mount v. Seholes, 120 III. 304, 399, 11 N.E. 401. 402 (1887).

to sue and recover from A in a separate action. This was so because the early Common Law doctrine was that the 

only remedy where Cross-Demands existed was for each party to sue separately,” 


The absurdity of this situation became crystal clear in a situation where A sold a thousand bushels of Grade A 
wheat to B, but on delivery it turned out to be Grade B wheat, whereupon B refused to pay. When, therefore, A sued 
B for the purchase price, and B desired to cut down the amount of A’s recovery by asserting his Claim for Damages 
for Breach of Warranty, it was necessary for him to bring a separate action. 


However, through a long series of judicial decisions, the Common-Law Doctrine of Recoupment was developed. 
At first, Recoupment could be used solely as a Defense to diminish the plaintiff's recovery. Furthermore, it was 
confined to Contract Actions, and to Cross-Demands arising from the very contract sued upon by plaintiff.’ As it 
evolved, however, Recoupment came to lie for Matters arising from the same transaction, as well as the same 
contract.

It is not necessary that the Claim by wa) of Recoupment be a liquidated debt. It Stow v. Yarwood,” the Court 
speaks ol Recoupment as follows: “This Doctrine ol Recoupment tends to promote justice, and U prevent needless 
litigation. It avoids circuity of action, and multiplicity of suits. It adjusts by one action adverse claims growing out 
of the same subject-matter. Such claims can generally be much better settled in one proceeding, than in several. It is 
not necessary that the opposing claims should be of the same character. «++ A claim originating in contract, may be 
set up against one founded in tort. It is sufficient that the counter claims arise out of the same subject-matter, and 


that they are susceptible of adjustment in one action.” 13 


The Doctrine of Set-Off 

AT Common Law, where Cross-Demands existed, the defendant, until Recoupment was recognized, could not 
Pray for any Relief in his Pleadings. If he had a claim against the plaintiff, he could only set it up in another suit of 
his own. Although the Doctrine of Set-Off of Mutual Claims had early been recognized in Equity, it had not found 


its way into the Common Law. But in 1729 the doctrine was incorporated into the Common Law by means of the 
Statute of 2 George 11, c. 22, § 13, 16 Statutes at Large 53 (1729). 


By this Statute a defendant was allowed in an Action upon a Debt to set up a liquidated demand of his own to 
counter-balance that of the plaintiff, either in whole or in part!”

WHERE a defendant pleads in Confession and Avoidance, at the Replication stage of Pleading the plaintiff may 
Demur or Plead. If he does not Demur, he may deny or traverse the truth of the matter alleged in the Plea, either in 
Whole or in Part, or he may confess and Avoid the Plea.’ If he decides upon the latter, he must be careful to avoid a 
Departure, which, in the case of the plaintiff, is an abandonment at a later Stage of Pleading of the ground on 
which the plaintiff placed his Cause of Action. li-i case of an Evasive Plea it may be permissable for plaintiff to 
enter a New Assignment, and, in some cases, he may Reply by showing Matter in Estoppel. 


To a large degree, the Requisites of a Replication resemble those of a Plea, and are, first, that it must Answer so 
much of the Plea as it professes to Answer; second, that it must not Depart from the Cause of Action

set up in the Declaration; third, that, like a Plea, it should be Certain, Direct and Positive, and not Argumentative; 
and fourth, that it must be Single. 


THE REPLICATION DE INJURIA—DEFINITION, SCOPE ANT? AVAILABILITY 


280. In certain Actions, where the defendant Pleads Matter of Excuse, the plaintiff, instead of Traversing 
Specially, is permitted to Reply by a Denial in General and Summary Terms. This Traverse is used only to Deny 
Matter of Excuse, and occurs only in the Replication. Such a Pleading is Known as the Replication De Injuria. 


A REPLICATION DE INJURIA is a compenius Form of Denial which, broadly speaking, does for the plaintiff at 
the Replication Stage of Pleading, what a Plea of the General Issue does for the defendant at the Plea Stage of 
Pleading, that is, it denies all the Material Allegations in the Plea. But in what situation is this most technical 
procedural device used? If we suppose that the defendant’s Plea sets out several Distinct Matters which are essential 
to constitute his Defense, the General Rule has been, according to the principles so far observed, that the plaintiff, in 
framing his Reply to such a Plea, was required to select one of the several Facts or Matters alleged and Traverse or 
Confess and Avoid that Particular Fact or Matter, and, as an incident thereof, admit by implication all the other 
matters. Thus, for example, in Trespass De Bonis Asportatis for taking goods, conceivably the defendant might 
Plead that the goods in question consisted of a number of cases of alcoholic liquor, that the plaintiff was unlawfully 
in possession of them, having no License to keep such goods and having them f or illegal sale, that the defendant 
was an officer having the authority to seize liquors unlawfully kept, and that he did seize them for the reason stated, 
and delivered them to the officer appointed by the Law to receive goods so seized. Assuming that the goods were 
not contraband, that the 
plaintiff had lawful possession of them, that the defendant was not an officer, that he had no authority to seize any 
goods, and that he used the goods for his own consumption, the plaintiff, at the Replication Stage of Pleading might 
Reply by Traversing any one of the facts relied upon by the defendant. If, however, he undertook to Traverse more 
than one, or all of these facts, he would be guilty of violating the Rule of Pleading against Duplicity, unless the 
Common-Law Rule as to Singleness of Fact Denied be changed in such a situation. The Common-Law, under such 
circumstances, did permit the plaintiff to Traverse a Plurality of Matters or Facts contained in the defendant’s Plea, 
by Replying that the defendant committed the trespasses stated itt the Declaration, of his own wrong and without 
such cause as in the plea alleged, Dc Injurja Sua Pro pr-ta Abs que Tali Ca-usa. Such a Form of Replication, 
known as a Replication De Injuria,” operates as a Compendious Denial of Every Material Fact set out in the Plea, 
thus creating an Issue of Fact, just as the General Issue enabled a defendant to Traverse, at the Plea Stage of the 
Pleading, all the Material Allegations in the plaintiff s Declaration. The Replication De Injuria differed from a 
Common Ti-averse, which was a Denial of a Material Allegation of Fact in the Pleader’s Own Language, in that the 
Replication De Injuria was not a Denial in Direct and Categorical Terms, but rather by a Fixed Form in the Nature 
of a Blanket Negation and in that it operated to put in Issue Not One, but All the Material Facts constituting the 
defendant’s composite Defense. 


The General Rule as to When the Replication Dc Infuria May be Interposed to a Plea 
THE Common-Law Rule was that a Replication could not be Double or contain Two or More Replies to the 
Same Plea. And it

should be kept in mind that the Statute of Anne,” enacted in 1705, which permitted a defendant to Plead Several 
Defenses, did not extend to Replications, except in the single instance of a Plea in Bar to an Avowry in Replevin, 
which is in the Nature of a Replication, but which is in reality a Plea, as the Avowry was in reality in the Nature of a 
Declaration. 


Page 545 of 735 


Where a Plea sets up a series or group of circumstances which together constitute the Defense, the strict Theory 
of Pleading requires the plaintiff to select some one of such Several Matters and take Issue upon that Single Specific 
Allegation alone. The Replication De Injuria, like the General Issue, is an instance of Licensed Duplicity, to permit a 
Denial of Several Matters in one Compendious Form. Before the enactment of Modern Statutes permitting the filing 
of more than One Replication, the use of the Replication De Injuria was of great advantage to the plaintiff as it put 
the defendant to the Proof of all the Material Allegations in his Plea, instead of leaving the plaintiff to stand or fall 
by the Denial of a Single Allegation, the others being admitted by failure to Deny them.” 


As the General Issue was used by a defendant, so a Replication Dc Injuria was available to the plaintiff at the 
Replication Stage of Pleading. It was said to be a Uniform 


4.4 Anne, c. 16, ~ 4, 11 Statutes at Large 135 (1705). Since the Statute, which permitted the dofenriant to Plead more than One Defense or 
Plea to a Singlo Count, did not give plaintiffs a similar privilege of making more than One Replication to One Plea, the Proeethiral 
Device of the Replication Dc Injuria, which was a Comprehensive Traverse, was created to cover the need, and become of 
groat importance. But under the Modern Procedure Reforms, the great mass of technical learning on the subject has become 
largely obsolete. Ames, cases on Pleading, 104, note (24 ed., Cambridge 1905).

Rule that such a Replication would be used only when the defendant set up Matter merely in Excuse of the wrong 

alleged in the Tort Actions of Trespass and Case, and the Contract Actions of Assumpsit, Covenant and Debt, and 

where such Plea was untrue.e It was said not to be admissible where the Facts Pleaded amounted to a Justification.~ 

It was not, however, an easy matter to distinguish between Matter of Excuse and Matter of Justification. 

Accordingly, it is not surprising to learn that Dc Injuria has frequently been used in Replying to Pleas which were in 

Justification and not in Excuse, As a result the distinction caine to be largely disregarded in both England and the 

United States.” 


The Effect of the Replication Dc Injuria 

THE Complete Form of this Traverse is Dc Injuria Sua Propria Absque Tali Causa (that the defendant, of 
his own wrong, and without any such cause as his Plea alleged), committed the injury complained of.° It is preceded 
by a general Inducement or Introduction, and Denies, in General and Summary Terms, and

defendant’s Pica contai,,s Matter of Excuse. Murden v. Russell, S Boyce (Del.) 362, 93 A. 379 (1915). But, in the Federal 
Courts, no such distinction was observed. Erskine v. Hohabach, 14 Wall. 624, 20 L.Ed, 745 (1871).

not in the Words of the Allegation Traversed, all that is last before alleged; but neither the Form of the Denial nor 
the Inducement Dc Injuria, etc. alleges New Matter; it simply reaffirms in General Terms the wrongs complained of 
in the Declaration, and the Traverse Abs que Tali Causa is an Abridged Denial of the Special Justification in the 
Plea. 


Page 546 of 735 


The effect of the Traverse is to Deny all the Material Allegations in the Pica, as it goes to the Whole Plea, but 
only where such Allegations show Matter of Excuse for the Tort or injury committed.'° It can never be used when 
the Matter set forth in the Plea is insisted on as conferring a positive right.” Its import is to insist that the defendant 
committed the act in question from a different motive than that assigned in the Plea. 


FORMS OF PLEA AND REPLJCATION DE INJURIA THERETO 
281. This section illustrates Form of Plea In Confession and Avoidance and Replication de Injuria. 


SUPPOSE that in trespass for assault and battery the defendant pleads self-defense (son assault demesne) in 
Confession and Avoidance, as follows: 


And for a further Plea in this behalf, as to the said assaulting, beating, wounding, and ill-treating, in the said 
Declaration mentioned, the defendant, by leave of the Court here for this purpose first had and obtained, according 
to the form of the Statute in such

Where the Defense Is an Excuse for the Noaperformalice of a Promise which the defendant made, however many the parts or 
facts of that Excuse may be, the Replication Be Injuria denies them all.

ease made and provided, says that the plaintiff ought not to have or maintain his aforesaid action thereof against 
him, because, he says, that the plaintiff, just before the said time, When, etc., to wit, on the day and year aforesaid, at 
aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, with force and arms, made an assauit upon him, the said defendant, and would 
then and there have beaten and ill-treated him, the said defendant, if he had not immediately defended himself 
against the plaintiff; wherefore the said defendant did then and there defend himself against the plaintiff as he 
lawfully might, for the cause aforesaid, and in so doing did necessarily and unavoidably a little beat, wound, and 
ill-treat the plaintiff, doing no unnecessary damage to the plaintiff on the occasion aforesaid; ant! so the defendant 
saith, that if any hurt or damage then and there happened to the plaintiff, the same was occasioned by the said assault 
so made by the plaintiff on him, the said defendant, and in the necessary defense of himself, the said defendant, 
against the said plaintiff, which are the supposed trespasses in the introductory part of this Plea mentioned, and 
whereof the said plaintiff hath above complained. And this the defendant is ready to Verify. Wherefore he Prays 
Judgment if the plaintiff ought to have or maintain his aforesaid action thereof against him. 


In such a case a Replication Dc Injuria would be as follows: 


And as to the said Plea by the said defend-. ant last above Pleaded in Bar to the said several Trespasses in the 
Introductory Part of that Plea mentioned, the said plaintiff says that, by reason of anything therein alleged, he ought 
not to be Barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action thereof against the defendant, because, he says, 
that the defendant, at the said time when, &c., of his own wrong, and without the cause in the said last-mentioned 
Plea alleged, committed the said several trespasses in the Introduc

tory Part of that Plea mentioned, in Manner and Form as the plaintiff hath above complained. And this he Prays may 
be Inquired of by the Country. 
Tee 
VORMAL PARTS OF REPLICATION 

282. Properly Commencing and Concluding a Rephication reguires considerable skill in Pleading, hence some suggestions 

as to the Formal Parts of a Replication are discussed below. 


Page 547 of 735 


A REPLICATION was usually Entitled in the Court and of the Term at which it was Pleaded; and the names of 
the plaintiff and of the defendant were stated in the margin— thus, “AD. v. C.D.” ~- 


When the Body of the Replication only contained an Answer to a Part of the Plea, the Commencement should 
then specify the Part intended to be Answered, for if the Commencement professed to Answer the Whole. but the 
Body contained an answer to Part only, the whole Replication was insufficient. 


Every Replication must Conclude either to the Country or with a Verification and Prayer of Judgment. 


A Replication to a Plea in Bar has this 

Commencement: ~+» Says that by reason of anything in the said Plea alleged he ought not to be barred from 
having and maintaining his aforesaid action against him, the said C.D., because, he says,” etc. This Formula is 
commonly called “Precludi Non.” The Conclusion is thus: In Debt, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his debt 
aforesaid, together with his Damages by him sustained by reason of the detention thereof, to be adjudged to him;” in 
Covenant, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his Damages by him sustained by reason of the said Breach of 
Covenant, to be adjudged to him;” in Trespass, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his Damages by him sustained 
by reason of the committing of the said Trespasses, to be ad- 


13. Chitty, On Pleading, c. VIII, Of Replicatlons, 628 (16th Am. ed. by Perkins, Springifeld 1876). 

judged to him;” in Trespass on the Case, in Assumpsit, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his Damages by him 
sustained by reason of the not performing of the said Several Promises and Undertakings, to be adjudged to him;” in 
Trespass on the Case in General, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his Damages by him sustained by reason of 
the committing of the said several grievances, to be adjudged to him.” 


And so, in all other actions, the Replication Concludes with a Prayer of Judgment for Damages, or other 
appropriate redress, according to the nature of the action. 


With respect to Pleadings Subsequent to the Replication, it will be sufficient to observe, in general, that those on 
the part of the defendant follow the same form of Commencement and Conclusion as the Plea; those on the part of 
the plaintiff, the same as the Replication. 


STATUS OF THE 
INJURIA UNDER 
PRACTICE ACTS 
COURT 


283. Cases decided under Modern Codes, Practice Acts, and Rules of Court, evince the continued existence and 
application «the Replication De Injuria. 


UNTIL somewhat more than a century ago, the Replication De Injuria was limited to Trespass and Trespass on 
the Case; in 1832, as a result of Selby v. Bardons, + it was extended to Replevin. Two years later, the situation was 
complicated by the promulgation of the Hilary Rules, which sought to restrict the Scope of the General Issues in the 
Various Forms of Action. As one of the consequences the institution of Special Pleading was given an additional 
impetus, thus causing great difficulty when it came to framing Replications in Contract Actions. It is, therefore, not 
surprising to find that the English courts began, in the year 1836 in the case of Issac

v. Farrar,” to hold that the Replication IDe Injuria was applicable to an Action of Trespass on the Case for a 
Breach of Promise. 


In the United States, where, in theory at least, the Hilary Rules had not been adopted, it was natural that the 


Page 548 of 735 


English decisions, as influenced by those Rules, should not be adopted. Thus, we find Gould stating that the 
Traverse Dc In~uria, ccc., Abs que Tall Causa, though of frequent occurrence, is confined to actions Ex Delicto, and 
used only in Replications.’” 


But this view did not prevail, as shown by the Statement of Scudder, J., in the New Jersey case of Ruckman v. 
The Ridge field Park Railroad Company,” in which it was urged that the Replication De Injunia was inapplicable 
in Actions Ex Contractu. The Judge declared: “Formerly the General Traverse, Dc injuria, was confined in 
practice to Actions of Trespass, Replevin, and cases for injuries. But when, under the New Rules [the Hilary Rules], 
Special Pleas in Excuse became frequent in Actions of Assumpsit and Debt on Simple Contracts, it became 
reasonable that the plaintiff should be allowed to take Issue by a General Traverse of the Whole Matter of Excuse 
alleged, and such Pleading was sustained by the Courts. There was no occasion to use this Replication when the 
usual Plea in Assumpsit was the General Issue. But, as more Special Defenses by Pleading are being favored in the 
modern practice of our Courts and by Legislation, the Replication De Injuria becomes applieable as a General 
Traverse of the Excuse and all the Material Allegations in the Special Plea. It is only allowed where the Plea is in 
Excuse, and not in Denial of the Cause of Action. It is bad when the

defendant insists on a Right as a Justification; nor is it permitted where the Plea amounts to Matter of Discharge and 

Not of Excuse, as when the Plea is Payment, Accord and Satisfaction, Release, tcc.” ~ 


Prior to the Ruckman Case, however, in England in 1852, under the first Common-Law Procedure Act,” it was 

provided that either Party might Plead, in Answer to the Plea or Subseguent Pleading of his adversary, the General 
Issue, using the following form: 
“The plaintiff Joins Issue on the defendant’s [1st] plea,’ or “the defendant Joins Issue~ upon the plaintiff s 
Replication’ to the first plea.” This Form of Replication, in Clover v. Diccon,”* was said, by Pollock, C.B., to be 
“in the nature of a General Replication De Znjuria,””' and the effect of such a Joinder was to place in Issue all the 
Material Allegations of the Pleading to which it was interposed. In Maryland, in 1856, or just four years after the 
English Act,” the Replication De Injuria was abolished by Statute and a Joinder of Issue was substituted in lieu 
thereof. And in the District of Columbia, as early as the year 1879, this Form of Joinder was authorized by a Rule of 
Court, the effect of which was to put in Issue the Substance of the Plea.” Jn most American Jurisdictions, following 
the example of Maryland, a similar Joinder of Issue has been authoniz~d in most actions and at any Stage of the 
Pleading, such Form of Pleading being broadly the equivalent of the Replication Dc Injuria, having the effect of a

otis Denial. Keigwin suggests that the practical effect is that in any action a Party may “not only Reply, but Rejoin 
or Surrejoin Dc Injuria” 21 He wrote that “some Lawyers who shudder at the imaginary intricacies of Pleading would 
be shocked to learn that they have all their lives been using the archaic and mysterious Replication Dc Injuria in 
disguise, and to an extent vastly beyond the 

e Contemplation of the Common-Law, very ‘much as the bourgeois in Moliere’s comedy was startled to discover

that he had always spoken prose without knowing that it was prose.” 26 


Two Delaware cases testify as to the con~Unued existence and application of the Replication Dc Injuria in its 
virgin form where the Code is not adopted. In the #irst case, Murden 
v. Russell,” decided in 1915, the plaintiff brought an Action of Trespass by Assault, and for the removal of the 
plaintiff s houseboat from a beach. The defendant Pleaded in Justification, that the title to the beach was in a Town, 
and that as the Agent of the Town, he removed the boat, as he lawfully might do, The plaintiff filed a Replication 
IDe Injuria to each of the two Pleas as set forth above, whereupon the defendant filed a Special Demurrer, on the 
ground, first, that such a Replication is proper only in Reply to a Plea in Excuse; and second, that such a 
Replication Is improper when the defendant, in his own right, or as a servant to another, claims an Interest or Title in 
Land, citing as authority the tamous English Crc gate’s Case,” New Jersey Case of Taverna v. Churchill,” and 
the New York Case of Plumb v. M’Crea.”°

The plaintiff did not dispute the principles urged in support of the Demurrer, and left the question of their 
application to the Court, which sustained the Demurrer and gave Judgment for the defendant, Boyce, 3., in 
accordance with the Rule at Common-Law, declaring: “The Replication Dc Injuria is proper when Matters in Excuse 
are pleaded; but when Justification, or a claim of Title or Interest in Land, is pleaded the Replication must be by way 
of a Special Traverse.” -° 


In the second case, Empire Box Corporation v. Jefferson island Salt Mining Co.,31 decided in 1941, the 
plaintiff filed a Declaration containing Four Counts, Three Special Counts, and One on a Common Count. To the 
eleventh and twelfth Pleas, the plaintiff filed a Replication Dc Injuria, whereupon the defendant entered a Special 
Demurrer, on the grounds first, that a Replication De Injuria is not available in Actions Ex Contractu; and second, 
that a Replication IDe Injuria is not permitted where a Plea sets forth Matters of Discharge. The Special Demurrer to 
the Replication IDe Injuria was sustained on the ground that such Form of Replication was not a Proper Form of 
Traverse in an Action of Assunipsit. While this is not correct as the Replication Dc Injuria finally developed, the 
position of the Court is made clear by Chief Justice Layton, who declared: “The System of Pleading in force in this 
State, and strictly adhered to, is that System which prevailed in England at the time of our Independence except as 
changed or modified by Constitutional or Statutory Enactment. In Asswnpsit, the General Issue of Non-Assumpsit 
puts the whole Declaration in issue, and almost everything may be given in evidence which shows that the plaintiff 
at the time of Commencing Suit had no Cause of Action. Reading’s Heirs v. State, 1 Han. 190. By the Rules adopted

Law at Westminster at Hilary Term, 1834, it was provided that ‘in every Species of Assumpsit, all matters of 
Confession and Avoidance, including not only those by way of Discharge, but those which show the transaction to 
be either void or voidable in point of Law, on the ground of fraud or otherwise, shall be Specially Pleaded ««~ These 


Rules are not in force in this State. Wooley, Del. Pr. § 340, 1463. The Replication Dc Injuria is a Species of 
Traverse varying from the Common Form of General Denial. At the Common Law it was confined to Actions of

129. There is, perhaps, no direct decision in this State which so limits the use of this Form of Traverse, but the 
limitation is necessarily inferred from the System of Pleading itself in force with us, and from whatever decisional 
authority there may be. Thomas v. Black, S Houst. 507, 18 A. 771; Murden v. RusseU, 5 Boyce 362, 93 A. 379; 


Woolley, Del.Pr. § 475. In England, after the adoption of the Hilary Rules by which the Scope of the General Issue 
in Assumpsit was greatly narrowed, the use of this Form of Traverse seems to have been permitted in Actions Ex 
Contractu; and the decision in Ridgefield Park R. R. Co. v. Ruckman, 38 N.J,L. 98, is apparently based on the 
System of Pleading obtaining in the State of New Jersey in which Special Pleas in Excuse of alleged Breach of 
Contract were allowed to be Pleaded.” 


DEPARTURE DEFJNED AND THE REASON 
FOR THE RULE AGAINST DEPARTURE 


284. A Departure is an Abandonment at a Later Stage of Pleading of the Ground on which the Plaintiff 
has placed his Cause of Action, or the Defendant his Defense. Such a Fault in Pleading is not permitted as the 
Record would by such means be extended to an in- 
definite length, and the Formulation of a Specific Issue unnecessarily delayed. 


Departure Defined 

THE Common-Law Rule was that in Pleading there must be no Departure. A Departure occurs where, in any 
Pleading, a Party Abandons the Ground taken in his last Antecedent Pleading, and Resorts to Another, distinct from 
and not fortifying the first. From this definition it becomes clear that this Fault in Pleading can never arise until the 
Replication, but it may arise in that or any Subsequent Stage of Pleading. It is, therefore, a Settled Rule that the 
Replication or Rejoinder must not Depart from the Allegations of the Declaration or Plea in any material matter.” Its 
most frequent point of occurrence is in the Rejoinder by the defendant, and the Fault may be either in the Substance 
of the Defense, or the Law on which it is founded, and this also applies where plaintiff Departs in his Replication 
from the Ground on which he placed his Action in the Declaration. The Pleader must not Abandon a Previous 
Ground in his Pleading and assume a New One, For

A Replication in Estoppel is No Departure or abandcoiment of the ease statod in the Declaration. 

The Reason for the Rule Against Departure THE Rule against Departure was evidently 

necessary to prevent the retardation in the development of the Issue. For, while the Parties, in Pleadin~ are 
respectively confined to the grounds they have first taken in their Declaration or Plea, the Process of Pleading, after 
a few Alterations of Stateinent, will exhaust all the Facts involved in the cause, and thereby develop the Issue in 
dispute. But if at any Stage of the Available Series of Pleadings, a New State of Facts be introduced, the 
Termination of the Pleadings in a Single, Clear-Cut, Well-Defined Issue of Fact, is in consequence postponed. 
Besides, if One Departure were permitted, the Parties might, on the same principle, shift their ground, either in Point 
of Fact or in Point of Law, as often as they pleased; and an almost indefinite, if not intolerable length of altercation 
might, in many cases, be the consequence. 


THE KINDS OF DEPARTURES AND THE STAGE OF PLEADING AT WHICH 
THEY MAY OCCUR 


285. Departures were of Two hinds, being either in Point of Fact, or in Point of Law. The earliest Stage of 
Pleading at which a plaintiff may Depart is in the Replication; the earliest Stage of Pleading at which a 
defendant may Depart is in the Rejoinder. 


Departure in the Replication 
THE Replication is the earliest Stage of Pleading at which the plaintiff may be guilty of the Fault of Departure. 
And such a Departure may be in Point of Fact or in Point of Law. 


(I) In Point of Fact.—Thus, for example, where, ha Special Assumpsit, the plaintiffs, as Executors, declared 
on several Promises alleged to have been made to the testator in his lifetime, the defendant Pleaded that she did not 


Promise within six years before the obtaining of the Original Writ of the plaintiffs, to which the plaintiffs Replied 
35. Lee v. Rogers, 1 Let 110, 83 Eng.Rep. 322 (1663); 
Cole,. Hawkins, 10 Mod. 348,88 Eng, lte-ti759 (1717). 


that, within six years before the obtaining of the Original Writ, the Letters Testamentary were granted to them, 
whereby the action accrued to them, the said plaintiffs, within six years, the Court held that there was a Departure, 


Page 552 of 735 


as in the Declaration they had laid Promises to the Testator, whercas in the Replication they had alleged a Right of 
Action as accruing to themselves as Executors.” If they meant to put their action on this ground, in the Declaration 
they ought to have laid Promises to themselves, as Executors. 

(D In Point of Law.—Thus, for example, in Mole v. Wallis,’’ where the plaintiff declared in Covenant on an 
Indenture of Apprenticeship, by which the defendant was to serve him for seven years, and Assigned, as Breach of 
Covenant, that the defendant left his service within the seven years, the defendant Pleaded Infancy, to which the 
plaintiff Replied that, by the Custom of London, infants may bind themselves as apprentices, the Court held there 
was a Departure in Point of Law between the Declaration and the Replication, as that which is Pleaded Generally as 
the Common Law cannot be maintained by a Custom. 


Departure in the Rejoinder 

THE Rejoinder is the earliest Stage of Pleading at which the defendant may be guilty of the Fault of Departure, 
and it occurs more frequently at this point than in the Replication. And such a Departure may be in Point of Fact or 
in Point of Law, 


(D In Point of Fact.—Thus, for example, in Debt on a Bond conditioned to perform an Award, so that the same 
was delivered to the defendant by a certain time, the defendant Pleaded that the Arbitrators did not make any Award, 
to which the plaintiff replied that the Arbitrators did make an Award to such an effect, and that the same was 


-Hickman v. Walker, Willes 27, i25 Eng.Bep. 1037 (1737). 
527 


Tendered by the proper time, to which Replication the defendant Rejoined that the Award was not so Tendered, to 
which Rejoinder the plaintiff Demurred on the ground that the Rejoinder was a Departure from the Plea in Bar. In 
sustaining the plaintiff's Demurrer, the Court relied on the fact that in the defendant’s Original Plea in Bar, he had 
said that the Arbitrators made no Award, whereas, in his Rejoinder, he implicitly confessed that the Arbitrator had 
made an Award, but says that it was not Tendered according to the condition of the bond. This, in the view of the 
Court, was a clear Departure, for it is one thing not to make an Award and another thing not to Tender it when made. 
And although these things were necessary, by the condition of the bond, to bind the defendant to perform the Award, 
yet the defendant should have relied only upon one or the other by itself.” 


And so where the plaintiffs declared in Debt on a Bond conditioned to keep the plaintiffs harmless and 
indemnified from all suits of one Cook, the defendants Pleaded that they had kept the plaintiffs harmless, to which 
the plaintiffs Replied that Cook had sued them, so that the defendants had not kept them harmless, to which the 
defendants Rejoined that they had not had any notice of the Damnification. The Court held first, that the Matter of 
the Rejoinder was bad, as the plaintiffs were not legally bound to give notice; and second, that the Rejoinder was a 
Departure from the Plea in Bar, as in the Plea in Bar the defendants Pleaded that they had saved harmless the 
plaintiffs, whereas in the Rejoinder they confessed that they had not saved the plaintiffs harmless, and said that they 
had not had Notice of the Damnification; which was a plain Departure?°

And where, in Debt on a Bond conditioned to perform the covenants in an indenture of lease, one of which was 
that the lessee, at every felling of wood, would make a fence, the defendant Pleaded that he had not felled any wood, 
to which the plaintiff Replied that he felled two acres of wood, but make no fence, to which the defendant Rejoined 
that he did make a fence, the Court held there was a Departure.*° 


(ID In Point of Law.—The cases discussed above were cases in which the defendant, at the Rejoinder Stage of 


Pleading, deserted the ground, in Point of Fact, that he had first taken in his Plea. It is, however, also a Departure, 
where he puts the Same Facts on a new ground in Point of Law, as where he relies on the effect of the Common Law 


Page 553 of 735 


in his Plea, and on a Statute in his Rejoinder. 


Thus, where, in Trespass, the defendant made Title to the premises, Pleading a demise for fifty years made by a 
certain college, to which the plaintiff Replied that there was another lease of the same premises, which had been 
assigned to the defendant, and which was unexpired at the time of the making of the said lease for fifty years, and 
alleged a proviso in the Act of 31 Hen. VIII, c. 13, 4 Statutes at Large 455 (1539), avoiding all leases, by the 
colleges to which that Act related, made under such circumstances as the lease last mentioned, to which the 
defendant, by way of Rejoinder, Pleaded another Proviso in the Statute, which allowed such leases to be good for 
twenty-one years, if made to the same person, and that by virtue thereof, the devise stated in his Plea was available 
for twenty-one years at least, the Judges held the Rejoinder to be a IDe-

parture from the Plea; “for in the Bar Pleads a lease for 50 years, and in the F joinder he concludes upon a lease for 

years.” And they observed that “the ci fendant might have shown the statute a’ the whole matter at first.” a 


THE MODE OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A DEPARTURE 


286. The Method of Taking Advantage 
the Fault of Departure is by a General Th murrer; it involves, however, an Exception 1 the General Rule that a 
violation of a Rule Pleading constitutes a Defect in Form. 


AT Common Law any violation of a Rul of Pleading was said to create a Defect ii Form; any violation of a Rule 
of Substantivi Law a Defect in Substance. As a Departun involved a violation of the Rule of Pleadin~ that there 
must be No Departure, it would appear, on analysis, that such a Fault constituted a Defect in Form and should, there- 
fore, have been available on Special Demurrer. But this was not the Law; the Rule was that the Mode of taking 
Advantage of a Departure was by General Demurrer,” the Fault being an Active Abandonment of the ground on 
which the plaintiff had placed his Cause of Action or the defendant his Defense, and hence it was treated as a Fault 
in Substance.*? A Verdict in favor of him who makes the Departure will cure the Fault, however, if the Matter 
Pleaded by way of Departure is a sufficient Answer, in Substance, to what is before Pleaded by the adverse party; 
that is, if it would have been 


41, Pulrnerston v, Steward, Flow. 102, 73 Engitep160 (1554). 


42. The availability of the Fault of Departure on a 
General Demurrer, results from the fact that the 
Defect of Departure is one of the Five Exceptions to 
the General Rule that a Violation of a Rule o' 
Pleading constitutes a Defect in Form.

sufficient provided he had Pleaded it in the first instance.’ 


STATUS OF DEPARTURE UNDER MODERN 
CODES, I~RACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 


287. In general, under Modern Codes and 
Practice Acts, the Common-Law Doctrine as to Departure still prevails. 


THE rule as to Departure under Modern Codes and Practice Acts is generally the same as at Common Law, that 
is, that the plaintiff in his Replication, and the defendant in his Rejoinder, may not Depart from the Cause of Action 
set forth in the Declaration or the Defense set forth in the Plea.“ 


Page 554 of 735 


Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where there is no counterclaim or cross claim in the Answer, a Reply 
is permitted under Rule 7(a) only upon order of the Court. It has been contended that a rigid enforcement of the Rule 
against Departure would be Inconsistent with the Spirit of the Federal Rules, particularly as it is said that the Plead- 
ings are no longer of the same importance in the Formulation of Issues, the Pre-Trial Conference and Discovery 
having presumably taken over much of this task. 


NEW ASSIGNMENT—DEFINITION, NECESSITY AND APPLICATION 


288. A New Assignment is a restatement in the Replication of the plaintiff's Cause of Action. Where the Declaration in an Action is 
ambiguous and the defendant Pleads Facts which literally are an Answer to it, but not to the Real Claim set up by the 
plaintiff, the plaintiff s course is to Reply by Way of New Assignment, that is, to allege that he brought his Action, 
not for the cause supposed by the

defendant, but for some Other Cause, to which the Plea had no application, 


THE necessity for this Form of Procedural Device arose from the very General Mode of Statement sometimes 
permitted in the Declaration, as in Trespass to land. This made it possible for the defendant to Plead an evasive Plea, 
which, in turn, rendered it necessary for the plaintiff in his Replication to restate the Cause of Action intended, with 
greater precision and particularity. 


Thus, for example, in an action of Trespass for Assault and Battery, a case may occur in which the plaintiff has 
been twice assaulted by the defendant; and one of these assaults may have been Justifiable, being committed in Self- 
Defense, while the other may have been committed without Legal Excuse. Supposing the plaintiff to bring his action 
for the latter, it will be found, by referring to the Form of Declaration for Assault and Battery, that the statement is 
so General as not to indicate to which of the two assaults the plaintiff means to refer.*' The defendant may therefore 
suppose, or affect to suppose, that the first is the assault intended, and will Plead Son Assault Dcmesne. This Plea 
the plaintiff cannot safely Traverse, because, as an Assault was in fact committed by the defendant, under the 
circumstances of Excuse here alleged, the defendant would have a Right, under the Issue Joined upon such Traverse, 
to prove those circumstances, and to presume that such Assault, and no other, is the Cause of Action. And it is 
evidently reasonable that he should have this Right; for if the plaintiff were, at the Trial of the Issue, to be allowed to 
set up a different Assault, the defendant might suffer, by a mistake

into which he had been led by the Generality of the Plaintiff's Declaration. The plaintiff, therefore, in the case 
supposed, not being able to safely Traverse, and having no ground either for Demurrer or for Pleading in Confession 
and Avoidance, has no course, but by a New Pleading to correct the mistake occasioned by the Generality of the 
Declaration, and to declare that he brought his action, not for the first, but for the second, assault; and this is called 
“New Assignment”. The mistake being thus set right by the New Assignment, it remains for the defendant to plead 
such Matter as he may have in Answer to the Assault last mentioned, the first being now out of the question.” There 


Page 555 of 735 


are other situations where similar considerations make necessary a New Assignment of the plaintiff's Real Cause of 
Action, which was left uncertain by reason of having been Generally Alleged in the Declaration. 


FORM OF NEW ASSIGNMENT 


289. A New Assignment appears in the Replication; it is not, however, a true Replication, as it does not attempt, by 
either Pleading by Way of Traverse or in Confession and Avoidance, to meet the Defendant’s Plea. 


THE Form of the Replication which appears below is a New Assignment in a case where the defendant, in 
Trespass for Assault and Battery, has Pleaded in Confession and Avoidance of Trespasses other than those intended 
to be declared upon by the plaintiff: 


FORM OF NEW ASSIGNMENT 


AND as to the said Plea of the said CD. by him secondly above pleaded, as to the said several trespasses in the 
introductory part of that Plea mentioned and therein attempted to be justified, the said LB. says that, by reason of 
anything in that Plea alleged, he ought not to be barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action thereof 
against the said C.D., because he says that he brought his said action, not for the Trespasses in the said second Plea 
acknowledged to have been done, but for that the said CD. heretofore, to wit, on the day of AD. 19_, with force 
and arms, at 

aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, upon another and different occasion, and for another and different 
purpose, than in the said second Plea mentioned, made another and different assault upon the said AR than the 
assault in the said second Plea mentioned, and then and there beat, wounded, and ill-treated him, in manner and form 
as the said A,B, bath above thereof complained; which said trespasses, above Newly Assigned, are other and 
different trespasses than the said trespasses in the said second Plea acknowledged to have been done. And this the 
said A.B. is ready to verify. Wherefore, inasmuch as the said C.D, hath not answered the said trespasses above 
Newly Assigned, he, the said A.R, Prays Judgment and his Damages by him sustained by reason of the committing 
thereof to be adjudged to him, etc. 


NEW ASSIGNMENT AS IN THE NATURE OF A NEW DECLARATION 


290. It has been said that a New Assignnient is in the Nature of a New Declaration, meaning that it is not a true 
Replication, as it does not profess to Reply to anything in the defendant’s Plea; rather it seeks to state afresh, and with 
greater detail, the Circumstances of the plaintiff’s case originally Generally Laid in the Declaration. 


A NEW ASSIGNMENT is said to be in the Nature of a New Declaration, although in reality it was a Form of 
Common-Law Amendment, which contrary to the Ordinary Amendment could be exercised as a Matter of Right 
rather than in the Discretion of the Court. It may, however, more properly be considered as a repetition of the 
Declaration, differing only in this: that it distillguishes the true ground of complaint as being 
4-. Id. at 222, 223.

different from that which is covered by the Plea. Being in the Nature of a New and Repeated Declaration, it is 
consequently to be framed with as much certainty or specification of circumstances as the Declaration itself. In some 
cases, indeed, it should be even more particular, so as to avoid the necessity of another New Assignment. Thus, 
if the plaintiff declares in Trespass Quare Clausum Fregit without naming the close, and the defendant pleads the 
Common Bar— a Plea of Libe rum Tenementum—, which obliges the plaintiff to New-Assign, he must, in his 
New Assignment, either give his close its name, or otherwise sufficiently describe it, even though such name or 
description was not required in the Declaration .- 


STATUS OF NEW ASSIGNMENT UNDER MODERN CODES. PRACTICE ACTS 
AND RULES OF COURT 


291. The need for New Assignment under the Codes is minimized by virtue of the more complete statement of the 
claim in the Complaint and the liberal rules with respect to ~amendment, but its use has been permitted under some 


Page 556 of 735 


Codes. 
SINCE the facts are fully set forth in plaintiffs Complaint under the Codes, there 


4. .Soe 1 Cliittv, On Pleading. e~ VII, Of Replicadons, 628 (14th Am. ed. by Perkins, Springfield, 
is considerably less need for New Assignment than there was at Common Law. 


However, in some Code States, the plaintiff is permitted to interpose a reply in the nature of New Assignment, 
where this becomes necessary in order to show that the plaintiff’ s action is grounded on matter other than that to 
which the Answer speaks." But the need for the use of such procedure is minimized by the fact that the same result 
can be accomplished by amendment of the Complaint.” 


Clark points out that the simplified pleading of the Federal Rules gives little or no occasion for the use of New 
Assigiinient, and concludes that it does not appear to be a matter of great importance in modern procedure, perhaps 
hardly justifying attempts which have been made to limit, if not prohibit, anything savoring of New Assignment.”

PRODUCTION OF ISSUE 


292. An Issue in Pleading is a Specific proposition or point of controversy, Affirmed on the O-~.te Side and Denied on the Other. 
The reduction of the controversy to Issues is the great Object of Pleading. 


WE have already seen that the defendant, in opposing the Allegations of the Declaration, must either Demur or 
Plead, and that, in the course of the Pleadings, they must finally reach a point where there is some question or point 
presented, Affirmed on One Side and Denied on the Other. The reduction of the controversy to some specific ques- 
tion is the Object of all Pleading, and when reached, it is called the “Issue”; and the Cause, when at Issue, is ready 
for Trial or for the decision of the Issue raised. A Demurrer, either by the defendant to the Declaration or Other 
Pleading of the plaintiff, or by the plaintiff to a Plea or Other Pleading of the defendant, being a Denial of the legal 
sufficiency of the Opposing Pleading, raises at once a Question of Law which it is always the peculiar Province of 
the Court to determine, without the aid of a Jury. This question must be decided before further proceedings are had, 
and it is therefore said that the Demurrer always Tenders an Issue in Law. Again, if the Declaration or Other 
Pleading is sufficient on its face, and no Demurrer is interposed, the Pleadings, whether of the defendant or the 
plaintiff, stating Matters of Fact, must at length reach a point where the 
Opposing Party will simply Traverse or Deny what is alleged, and this Traverse must always Tender an Issue, which 
is One of Fact, and which the formal words of the Traverse refer to a Trial by Jury, by concluding “to the Country.” 


The decision on an Issue of Law may not necessarily end the Pleadings, except for the time being, since if 


the Demurrer be overruled, the Party offering it is now generally allowed to Plead Over, as it is termed—that is, to 
offer the Pleading he would have made if he had considered the Pleading Demurred to sufficient; but the Tender and 


Page 557 of 735 


Acceptance of an Issue of Fact closes all Pleading in the Action, as there is then nothing left but a Trial, which must 
dispose of the Action on its Merits. 


TENDER OF ISSUE 


293. Upon a traverse, Issue must be Tendered- AU Pleadings which Form the Issue by an Affirmative and 
Negative must Conclude to the Conntry But where New Matter is introduced, the Pleading should always Conclude 
with a Verification. 


WE have before seen that it is the Object of All Pleadings to bring the Parties, in the course of their mutual 
altercations, to an Issue that is a single entire point, Affirmed on the One Side and Denied on the Other; and it is to 
effect this Object that the above Rule was established. There can be no arrival at this point until one or the other 
532 
See. 293 

PRODUCTION, TENDER, AND JOINDER OF ISSUE 
533 

of the Parties, by the Conclusion of his Pleading, offers an Issue for the acceptance of his opponent, and this offer is 
called the “Tender of Issue.” The Formulae of Tendering the Issue vary according to the Mode of Trial proposed. 
Upon a disputed Question of Fact the Issue is Tendered by a Conclusion to the Country—referring the question to a 
Trial by a Jury—usually in the following form: “And this the said A.B. Prays may be inquired of by the Country — 
if by the plaintiff; or, “And of this the said CD. puts himself upon the Country”—if by the defendant.’ Wherever, 
therefore, a Denial or Contradiction of Fact occurs in Pleading, Issue ought at the same time to be Tendered on the 
Fact Denied, by Concluding the Pleading in One of the above Forms, The Form of Tendering Issue to be tried by 
Matter of Record is as follows: The Party setting up the Matter of Record (in the Plea, for instance) says: “And this 
the said CD. is ready to Verify by the said Record.” The other Party, after denying the existence of the Record (in 
the Replication, for instance), says: “And this he, the said A.B., is ready to Verify when, where, and in such manner 
as the Court here shall order, direct, or appoint.” 


The reason is that, as it sufficiently appears what is the Issue or Matter in dispute, it is time the Pleadings should 
close and the method of deciding the Issue be adjusted; and the Conclusion in the above Form always refers the 
decision to a Trial by Jury. The Pleadings which should thus conclude “to the Country” embrace all Forms of the 


1. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleaffing in Civil Actions, - I, Of the Proceedings in an Action, from its Commencement to Its 
Termination, 48, 60 (Williston ed., Cambridge, Mass., 18-5). 


It is held, however, that there is no material differonce between these two Modes of Expression and that if “ponit se’ be substituted for “petit 
quod inquiratur,” or vice versa, the mistake Is unimportant. Weltale v. Glover, 10 Mod. 166, 88 Eng.Rep. 677 (1713). 

Traverse except the Special Form, and also Replications, Rejoinders, etc., which do not contain New Matter, but 

present an Affirmative or Denial in a direct and positive form. 


Conciw~ion by Verification 

When the Answering Pleading contains New Matter, introducing Statements of Fact not previously mentioned by 
the other side, the latter has the right to be heard in answer if the accompanying Denial is immaterial, and a Tender 
of Issue by the Party Pleading such matter would therefore be premature.” In such case, unless the New Matter is a 
Negative, the Pleading concludes with a “Verification,” as it is termed, generally in the following words: “And this 
the said A.B. is ready to Verify.” 


To this exception belongs the case formerly noticed, of Special Traverses. These, as already explained, never 
Tender Issue, but always Conclude with a Verification; and the reason seems to be, that in such of them as contain 
New Matter in the Inducement, the introduction of that New Matter will give the Opposite Party a right to be heard 
in answer to it if the absque hoc be immaterial, and consequently makes a Tender of Issue premature. And, on the 
other hand, with respect to such Special Traverses as contain no New Matter in the Inducement, they seem in this 
respect to follow the analogy of those first mentioned, though they are not within the same reason. 


Not only in the case of Special Traverses, but in other instances also, to which that Form does not apply, a 
Traverse may sometimes involve the Allegation of New Matter;

DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 
Ch. 24 

and in all such instances, as well as upon a Special Traverse, and for a similar reason, the Conclusion must be with a 
Verification, and not to the Country. An illustration of this is afforded by a case of very ordinary occurrence, viz., 
where the Action is in Debt on a Bond Conditioned for Performance of Covenants. If the defendant Pleads Generally 
Performance of the Covenants, and the plaintiff, in his Replication, relies on a Breach of them, he must show 
Specially in what that Breach consists; for to Reply Generally that the defendant did not Perform them would be too 
vague and uncertain. His Replication, therefore, setting forth, as it necessarily does, the circumstances of the Breach, 
discloses New Matter; and consequently, though it is a Direct Denial or Traverse of the Plea, it must not Tender 
Issue, but must Conclude with a Verification.‘ So, in another common case, in an Action of Debt on Bond 
conditioned to indemnify the plaintiff against the consequences of a certain act, if the defendant Pleads Non Dam- 
nificatus, and the plaintiff Replies, Alleging a Damnification, he must, on the principle just explained, set forth the 
circumstances, and the New Matter thus introduced will make a Verification necessary? To these it may be useful to 
add another example. The plaintiff declared in Debt on a Bond Conditioned for the Performance of certain Cove- 
nants by the defendant, in his capacity of Clerk to the plaintiff; one of which Covenants was to account for all the 
money that he should receive. The defendant pleaded performance. The plaintiff Replied, that on such a day such a 
sum came to his hands, which he had not accounted for. The defendant Rejoined, that he did account, and in the 
following manner: that thieves broke into

the counting-house and stole the money, and that he acquainted the plaintiff of the fact; and he Concluded with a 
Verification. The Court held that, though there was an express affirmative that he did account, in contradiction to the 
Statement in the Replication that he did not account, yet the Conclusion ~vith a Verification was right; for New 
Matter being alleged in the Rejoinder, the plaintiff ought to have liberty to come in with a Surrejoinder, and Answer 
it by Traversing the robbery. 


The application, however, to particular cases, of this exception, as to the introduction of New Matter, is 
occasionally nice and doubtful; and it becomes difficult sometimes to say whether there is any such introduction of 
New Matter as to make the Tender of Issue improper. Thus, in Debt on a Bond conditioned to render a full account 
to the plaintiff of all such sums of money and goods as were belonging to W. N. at the time of his death, the 
defendant Pleaded that no goods or sums of money came to his hands. The plaintiff Replied, that a silver bowl, 
which belonged to said W. N. at the time of his death, came to the hands of the defendant, viz, on such a day and 
year; “and this he is ready to Verify,” etc. On Demurrer, it was contended that the Replication ought to have 
Concluded to the Country, there being a complete Negative and Affirmative; but the Court thought it well 
concluded, as New Matter was introduced. However, the learned Judge who reports the case thinks it clear that the 
Replication was bad; and Mr. Sergeant Williams expresses the same opinion, holding that there was no introduction 
of New Matter such as to render a Verification proper.”

JOINDER OF ISSUE 


291. Issue, when well Tendered, must be accepted. The Rule applies both to Issues— 
(D In Fact; and (ID In Law 


IF issue be well Tendered both in Point of Substance and in Point of Form, nothing remains for the Opposite 
Party but to accept or Join in It; and he can neither Demur, Traverse, nor Plead in Confession and Avoidance.* 


The Form of accepting or Joining in the Tender of an Issue in Fact is by the use of the words “And the said A.B. 
doth the like.” This is called the “Similiter.” It is only required when the Conclusion of the Adverse Pleading 
Tenders a Trial by Jury, but is then essential. If omitted by the Party, it may be added for him to complete the 
Record, as, when the Issue is well Tendered, he has no option but to accept it.” An Issue need never be accepted 
unless it is well Tendered. If

the Opposite Party thinks the Traverse is Bad in Substance or in Form, or objects to the Mode of Trial proposed, in 
neither case is he obliged to add the Similiter; but he may Demur, and if it has been added for him he may strike it 
out and Demur. As now used, the Similiter serves to mark both the acceptance of the question itself and the Manner 
of Trial proposed. As the resort to a Jury could in ancient times only be had by consent of both the Parties, it appears 
to have been formerly used only to indicate an expression of such consent. A Form of the Joinder in Issue in Fact is 
set out below, and a Form of Joinder in Demurrer is heretofore set out in section 198 of Chapter 20, the Demurrer.

the Judges of the Court. In this connection, however, it should be kept in mind that sometimes the Court decides 
certain Issues of Fact, as when the Action is founded upon a Record and the defendant has pleaded Nut Tiel 
Record, as in an Action on a Domestic Judgment, or where a Jury Trial is waived. 


Where, therefore, upon a Demurrer, the Issue in Law has been Entered on Record, the next step at Common Law 
is to Move for a Conciliuhi, that is, to move to have a day appointed on which the Court will hear the Counsel of 
the Parties argue the Demurrer. In this country this development is described as placing the Demurrer on the 
argument list or “Law and Motion Calendar,” according to the practice which prevails. And on the day entered for 
argument, or as soon thereafter as the business of the Court will permit, the Demurrer is argued viva voce in Court 
by the respective counsel of both parties, after which the Judge or Judges announce their decision, 


Trial Without a Jury—Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law : 

IN some instances, at Common Law, a case might be tried by a Court without a Jury. This might occur where 
there was no right to a Jury Trial or where the parties had waived the right. In such Trials, the ordinary incidents of a 
Jury Trial, such as the Selection of Jurors, Requests to the Court to Charge the Jury, Exceptions to the Charge, 
various Motions, and Verdict, are absent. The Opening Statements be-

freely than in a Trial by Jury, but for the most part the Requirements of Proof are the same. Before final submission 
of the case to the Court for Judgment each Party has an opportunity to Request a Finding of Facts 2 and a Statement of 
the Conclusions of Law thereon, to serve as a basis of the Final Judgment, and, if it becomes necessary, to make an 
Appeal. Under Section 4213 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, the decision of the Court may be Oral 
or in Writing, and must state the Facts which it deems essential. 


Under Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in Trials by the Court upon the facts without a Jury or 
with an Advisory Jury, the Court is obligated to Find the Facts Specially ; and then state separately its Conclusions 
of Law thereon, after which it directs tilat the appropriate Judgment be entered. For purposes of Review, Requests for 
such Findings are not essential. Such Findings of Fact, however, shall not be set aside except where clearly 
erroneous. And, of course, the Trial Court must have had full opportunity to consider the credibility of the 
Witnesses. And if an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be deemed sufficient if the Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law appear therein.* 


TRIAL BY JURY 


296. At Common Law Trials by Jury were either at Bar or Nisi Prius, The latter type of Trial was a product of the 
Statute of Westminster II (1285), which permitted actions, except those of great importance, to be tried OUt on the Nisi Prius 
Circuits, thus eliminating the inconvenience to the Parties, Jurors and Witnesses of Attending the Trial at West

minster, when they lived in a distant County and the means of transportation were inadequate. 


Trial at Bar or at Nisi Prius 

TRIALS by the Jury are either at Bar, or Nisi Prius. Prior to the Statute of Westminster II (1285)~ civil causes 
were tried at the Bar, before all the Judges of the Court, in Term-Time; or, when of no great moment, before the 
Justices in Eyre. All causes anciently commenced in the Superior Common-Law Courts were tried at the Bar of the 
Specific Court in which they were commenced, wherever the Court might be sitting. The Jury was, therefore, 
necessarily brought before the Court from the County in which the Venue was laid by a Writ of Venire Facias 
Juratores. Only actions of great importance were brought in the Superior Courts, suits of less significance being 
disposed of in the Court Baron, the Hundred and County Courts. In time, however, by reason of the superior quality 
of justice administered in the Superior Courts, cases of a trifling amount and nature were brought to these Courts for 
Trial, and it imposed an intolerable burden upon the Parties, Jurors and Witnesses to compel them to attend the Trial 
at Westminster when they lived in a distant County and the means of transportation were scarce and difficult. 
Accordingly, at a very early date, the practice developed of continuing the cause from Term to Term in the Court 
above, provided the Justices in Eyre did not come into the County where the cause of action arose; and if it appeared 
that they arrived there during the continuance, the whole cause was removed from the Jurisdiction of the Superior 
Court to that of the Justices in Eyre.°

(Philadelphia, 1807). 


But when the Court of Common Pleas became fixed at Westminster Hall by virtue of Magna Charta in 1215,’ the 
practice of conducting Trials before the Bar of one of the Superior Courts, in cases which could not be properly 
removed therefrom, was fraught with great hardship to the Parties, Witnesses, and Jurors, whose attendance was 
required. Once it was recognized that the Fact-Finding Process could be separated from the Law and from the rest of 
the legal procedure involved, the way was opened to relieve the hardship to the Parties, Jurors and Witnesses occa- 
sioned by the necessity of traveling to Westminster in London. 


Page 563 of 735 


This relief came in 1285 in the Form of the Statute of Westminster IT, 13 Edw. I, c. 30, 1 Statutes at Large 203. 
Under this Statute power was conferred upon the Justices of Assize, who had superseded the Justices in Eyre, to try 
Common Issues in Trespass, and other less important actions, with instructions to return them, when tried, into the 
Superior Courts above, where alone Judgment could be Rendered and Enrolled.* 


Since, under the Statute, only the Trial, and not the determination in the entire case, was now to be conducted in 
the Lower Court, the Nisi Prius Clause was omitted from the Conditional Continuances. Instead, the Statute directed 
that there should be inserted in the Writs of Venire Facias the foflowing language, “that the Sheriff should cause 
the Jurors to come to Westminster (or wherever the King’s Courts should be held) on such a day in Easter and 
Michaelmas terms (Nisi Prius), unless before that day the Justices assigned to take Assizes shall come into his said 
County.” As the Justices in Assize were al

most certain to appear in the County before the Return Day of the Writ in the Superior Court in question, the Sheriff, 
by virtue of the Statute, Summoned the Jurors to Appear in the Court of the Judges of Assize, and there the Trial was 
carried on during the Vacation of the Upper Court. This Statute was commonly known and designated as the Statute 
of Nisi Prius (1285), and, in consequence, the same name was given to the Trial conducted in pursuance of its 
authority before the Justices of Assize.° 


The practice under the Statute of Nisi Prius (1285) developed an inconvenience. It arose out of the fact that the 
Sheriff made no Return of the Jury to the Superior Court. Thus, the parties to the action remained in ignorance as to 
the Names of the Jurors until they were actually called at the Trial. The Counsel of the Parties, therefore, found 
themselves unprepared to make Challenges or take Exceptions. This difficulty was corrected by the Statute of 42 
Edw. II, c. 11, 2 Statutes at Large 183, enacted in 1368. Under this Statute, the Method of Trial at Nisi Prius was 
changed. It was provided that no Inquest, except of Assize and Gaol Delivery, should be taken by Writ of Nisi Prius 
until after the Sheriff had made a Return of the Names of the Jurors to the Superior Court. 


Selection of the Jury—Summoning, ImpanelLing and Examining 

(I) Summoning the Jury.—When the parties have put themselves upon the Country, which is the technical way 
of referring the issue between them to the Jury, one of the Entries upon the Roll is the Award of the Mode of 
Decision, which, in the case of Trial by Jury, directs the issuance of a Writ of Venire Patios commanding the 
Sheriff of the County where the facts stated in the pleading 


S. See Martin, Civil Procedure at common Law, e. XIV, Trial, Verdict, Judgment and Execution, Article I, Trial, § 362, Trials by Jury Ordinary, 
307 (St. Paul, 1905). 
are alleged to have occurred, to Summon a Jury to try the issue. 


(ID impanelling the Jury.—When the Jurors appear in Court, the first step and one of the most important in 
Trial by Jury, is the process of Drawing and Selecting the Jurors from what is known as the “Panel.” It is a list of the 
prospective Jurors summoned by the Sheriff to serve on the Juries which may be needed during a Particular Term, or 
for the Trial of a Particular Action. The Names of these Jurors are written on ballots wor tickets and placed in a box, 
and from the larger number of prospective Jurors in the Panel, names are drawn by lot and called to be sworn as 
Jurors upon the Jury, unless challenged or excused. If the Original Panel be exhausted by Challenges or Excuses, a 
further supply, known as “Tales-men,” -may be summoned. 


D Challenges to the Jury.—Tidd says that Challenges are of two kinds, first, to the Array; and second, to 
the Polls?” 


Challenges to the Array took the form of an Exception to the Whole Panel, in which the Jury are Arrayed, or set 


Page 564 of 735 


in order by the Sheriff on his Return. Such objections to the Jury may be based upon some charge of partiality, or 
upon some default in the Sheriff, or his Deputy who Arrayed the Panel. Also, if there be no personal objection 
against the Sheriff, yet if he Arrays the Panel at the nomination, or under the direction of either

. “The qualification of a Tales man, In point of estate, is only five pounds per annum. And, by the 7 & 8 Wm. III, e. 32, § 3 [9 Stafutes at Large 
492 (1690)), the Sheriff is directed to return such persons, to serve upon the Tales, as shall be returned upon some other Panel, and then

party, it is good cause of Challenge to the Array. 


Challenges to the Polls, in capita, are exceptions to Particular Jurors. Accordthg to Sir Edward Coke, Challenges 
of this description are of four kinds: 


First, Propter Honoris Respectum, as if a Lord of Parliament be empanelled on a Jury, in which case he was 
permitted to challenge himself, or be. challenged by either party. 


Second, Pro pter Defectum, as if a Jury-man be an alien born, or a slave or bondsman, or if he is not a resident of 
the County, or lacks the necessary qualification of estate. 


Third, Propter Affecturn, as where a Juror is of kin to either party, within the ninth degree; that he has been 
arbitrator, or declared his opinion on either side; that he has an interest in the cause; that there is an action pending 
between him and the party; that he has accepted money for his Verdict, or even food and drink at either party’s 
expense; that he has formerly been a Juror in the same cause; or that he is the party’s master, servant, tenant, 
counsellor, steward, attorney, or of the same society or corporation with him. Besides these, there are Challenges to 
the Favour, where the party objects only on account of some probable rounds of suspicion, as aequathtance, and the 
like. 


Fourth, Propter Delictum, as where a Juror was challenged for a conviction of Treason, Felony, Perjury, or 
Conspiracy; or if, for some Infamous Offence, he has received Judgment of the Pillory, Tumbrel, or the like, or to 
be branded, whipped or stigmatized; or if he be outlawed or excommunicated, or has been attainted of False Verdict, 
Praemunire, or Forgery. 


(IV) The Examination of the Jurors.— Great latitude is permitted in the examination of Jurors on the Voir 
Dire, with regard to the various causes of Challenga, in order 
that there may be a full and thorough test of their qualifications. The extent of the Examination should fit the 
importance of the case, being searching and thorough in a momentous case, but brief in a minor one, and perhaps 
addressed to the whole twelve, rather than to the individuals separately. It is advantageous, if possible, to show 
confidence in the Jury. 


The Juror knows best his own condition of mind and may be examined fully, though not to his infamy or 
disgrace. Examples of the kinds of questions which may be put are as to his membership in secret organizations, un- 
der oath and obligation to assist fellow members; whether he has formed a partial opinion from rumors he has heard, 
or from the newspapers (facts not in themselves disqualifying, though, if taken with others, they might show bias, so 
further Examination is necessary to make a prima fade case for exclusion); whether he has any personal knowledge 
of the facts of the case, or has formed any opinion about it, which he would favor if the testimony were equally 
balanced; whether he has an opinion which it would require evidence to remove; whether his attention has been 
called directly or indirectly to any litigation of the same kind in such a way as to influence his Judgment (as if he 
were a plaintiff himself against an Insurance company); whether he has any prejudice against corporations, as 
grasping and oppressive; whether he would take the Law from the Court, and be guided and controlled by its 


Page 565 of 735 


Instructions, or whether he disagrees with some rule involved; whether he has conscientious scruples against the 
infliction of death penalty; in short, he may be Exammed generally in regard to his occupation, nationality, religion, 
social bonds, his sympathy and intellect, and evidence may be introduced by other witnesses as to his relations or 
expressions of opinion on the merits of the case. The grounds of objection should be specifically stated, in order to

in Law in ruling on the Challenges upon Motion for a New Trial.”* 


The Burden of Proof 

It may be said that in general the Burden of Proof will rest on the plaintiff for some specific propositions, but on 
the defendant for others,’* depending upon which side has the Affirmative or Negative of the points at issue. This 
turns on what facts in dispute are essential to the case, or prima fade Cause of Action, and what to the Defence, 
respectively; he who asserts must prove. The plaintiff must make out a prima facie Cause of Action, while the 
defendant must satisfy the Court of the truth and adequacy of any Defences of New Matter pleaded in Confession 
and Avoidance. As to these, the plaintiff need only repel the attack and keep them balanced or doubtful, that is, 
below the required degree of persuasion. 


(I) Prima Facie Case.—The first task of the plaintiff at the Trial is to make out a prima facie case by 
presenting proof of the facts or points essential to his recovery, if these be denied, in order to move the tribunal to 
decide in his favor. What facts and propositions are sufficient prima fade for a decision in the plaintiff’s favor are, 
in general, determined by the Rules of Substantive Law applicable to the particular case, as to what facts must be 
proved to make out a good cause of action; and, these in turn may be affected by the Rules of Pleading as to the 
Manner and Form required in the Statement of the Cause of Action, which marshal and apportion the respective 
grounds of Claim and Defence. But the Apportionment is not accomplished by the Pleading alone, but is further 
determined by the Specific Rules as to the Burden of Proof in various cases. Thus, there is no general test as to what 
con-

1, Outline of Proecedlngs In an Action, 35 (3rd ed. 
by Ballantine, St. Paul, 1023). 


14. lii. at 3t 
stitutes a prima fade showing, as this depends upon a combination of factors, such as the Substantive Law, the 
Rules of Pleading, and the Rules of Evidence, which in turn are affected by a sense of Fair Play and Public Policy. 


Under the irregularity of pleading which characterized the various Common-Law Forms of Action, and under the 
limited Series of Pleadings under the Codes, which ordinarily do not extend beyond the Replication Stage of 
Pleading, the Pleadings do not fully indicate by whom proof must be made or clearly Apportion to Each Party the 
propositions which are essential to his case, and which fall to him as the case progresses. 


Under an ideal System of Pleading, the turns and logical Stages of the Proof Process would be indicated by the 
Series of Pleadings, viz., the Declaration, Plea, Replication, Rejoinder, Surrejoinder, Rebutter and Surrebutter. But, 
as we have seen in the Chapter on Pleas, Peremptory or in Bar, the General Issue, at Common Law, did not always 
mean that the defendant’s Defences were Negative; in many instances Affirmative Defences were hidden 
thereunder; in consequence, the Pleadings sometimes failed to disclose who had the Burden of Proof. 


(II) The Burden of RebuttaL—When the plaintiff makes out his prima fade case by reasonable and credible 
evidence, the Burden of Proof is said to shift to the defendant, but this use of the phrase is very inaccurate and 
confusing. The plaintiff must at all times keep the proof of his contentions at the required height. This Ultimate 
Burden of making out a prima facie case and keeping it good cannot shift; - but the Burden of going for 


15. Professor James Bradley Thayer was the first to demonstrate clearly the inaccuracy of the expression that the Burden of Proof “shifts,” and to 
elaborate on the distinction between the Burden of Proof, in the sense of the “duty to establish,” which never shifts, and what Is awkwardly 
termed “the duty of going forward with the evidence,” which does have the characteristic referred to as ‘shift 


Page 566 of 735 


Sec. 296 
ward with the evidence may shift from time to time. Perhaps an illustration would help to make the matter clear. 


Suppose A brings Trespass for Assault and Battery against B, who pleads Self Defense, whereupon A Traverses 
the Plea, thus creating an Issue of Fact as to whether the defendant B did strike in Self Defense. At the Trial, as B’s 
Plea admits the striking, A has, at the outset, a prima facie case; but suppose B goes forward with the evidence by 
offering sufficient Proof of Self Defense, then the Burden of Rebuttal, or the need to go forward with the evidence 
and repel the Proof of B, shifts to A, who as tile asserter of the cause of action, or the proponent, must establish a 
Preponderance of Proof in favor of his cause of action, If he succeeds in this, the Burden of going fonvard with the 
evidence will again shift to B. Thus, in the course of the Trial, the Burden of going forward with the evidence may 
shift from the plaintiff to the defendant, and vice versa. When, however, the case finally goes to the Jury, the Burden 
is always on the Affirmative to keep a Preponderance of Proof in his favor, while the Negative is safe with an even 
balance or equilibrium. 


(Ill) Respective Functions of Judge and Jury.—Each Party must first pass the gauntlet of the Judge with his 
evidence in order to get to the Jury on the Issue. Unless the plaintiff makes a prima fade case and satisfies the 
Judge that he has sufficient evidence to be considered by the Jury, and to form a reasonable basis for the Verdict, a 
Motion for a Nonsuit should be granted by the Judge. This Motion may be made by defendant at the close of 
plaintiffs case, when it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish an alleged fact, and there is insufficient evidence 
on the point, or the only testimony contradicts it.

169 Ind. 518, 82 Nt. 1057 (1907). 
543 


A Motion to Direct a Verdict for insufficiency of the opponent’s evidence to go to the Jury may be made by either 
Party at the close of defendant’s case. The case should be taken from the Jury: (1) Where there is no evidence to 
support the Burden of Proof on some essential fact; (2) where there is no conflict in evidence, as where by the 
testimony of the plaintiff he put his head out of the window in the train, which is contributory negligence, and 
precludes recovery as a Matter of Law; (3) where the evidence is somewhat conflicting, but so certain and 
convincing that no reasonable man could decide otherwise. Directing a Verdict saves the need of a Motion for a 
New Trial; but the result of Setting Aside a Verdict is different, in that it results in a New Trial, while Directing a 
Verdict results in Final Judgment. The test for the Two Motions is not necessarily identical, though very similar.'° 
The Judge thus has supervisory control over the Proof and the Jury may be prevented from rendering a Verdict 
against reason which would later have to be set aside as against the evidence." 


By a Demurrer to the Evidence, interposed at the close of the plaintiff's evidence, the Court may be asked to 
pronounce the Law upon the case, admitting all facts which the evidence tends to establish and all reasonable 
inferences therefrom. Where the evidence fails to prove a prima facie case, the Demurrer will be sustained. In 
theory the Functions of Court and Jury are sharply divided. It is for the Court to decide Questions of Law and for 
the Jury to pass on Questions of Fact. In practice the Court has important functions in passing on the evidence and 
controlling the work of the Jury, and the Jury applies the Law to the facts under the Instructions of the Court.

of the Issues, he has the right to open the evidence and prove the facts on which he relies to establish his case. The 
defendant may then present evidence to contradict the plaintiff, and also to support his own propositions in defense, 
to relieve himself from the consequences of the plaintiff’s prima facie case, and by way of Cross-Action. Finally, 
the plaintiff may disprove in Rebuttal the affirmative portion of his opponent’s evidence. Affirmative Evidence 
cannot, in strictness, be given by the plaintiff in Rebuttal. He should not reserve his real or main attack until after he 
has drawn out the testimony of the other party, and until the defendant has closed his case. He should offer all his 
evidence in chief on the points upon which proof is essential to his recovery. In Rebuttal he is confined to Rebutting 
evidence only, unless the Court, for good reason, permits him to offer evidence on his original case, If the plaintiff 
be allowed to give Affirmative Evidence in Rebuttal, the defendant should be allowed to contradict it, by 
Surrebuttal; so where the credibility of defendant’s witnesses is assailed. Each side must in turn exhaust his case, 
and neither may give evidence by piecemeal, but must in the first instance produce all his evidence in chief, on 
which he relies to establish his case, and is confined in Rebuttal to the contradiction of affirmative facts brought out 
by his adversary’s evidence. But it is no objection to Rebuttal that it incidentally tends to corroborate the party’s 
case in chief. 


The plaintiff should not anticipate defenses, or attempt to disprove facts which have not yet been asserted, and 
upon which there may finally be no controversy. In an action for the price of goods sold, the plaintiff should prove 
sale, delivery, and acceptance of the goods, and then rest. He need not prove freedom from defects. If the defendant 
pro- 

-pounds this, the plaintiff may rebut or refute 
it. 


The departure from the regular order of iproof may be allowed in the sound exercise of 

discretion by the Court. While ordinarily the affirmative must exhaust his evidence before the other party begins, yet 
the Court may be requested to reopen the case at various stages of the Trial, and admit evidence which has been 
overlooked or newly discovered, even after one or both have “Rested”; i. e., formally announced that his evidence is 
closed, and even after motion for nonsuit or submission of the case to the Court. Particularly in the course of the trial 
the order of proof is discretionary, and the plaintiff may be permitted to strengthen his original case by the 
introduction of cumulative evidence in rebuttal, after the defendant has rested, if opportunity is given to the 
defendant to reply. But he must ask the Court to reopen the case for the purpose, or it may be excluded as part of the 
original case which should not have been withheld. 


The Right to Open or Close 

(I) The Objective Sought in the Exercise of the Right.—Generally speaking, at Common Law, the advantage 
of the Opening and Closing Speech to the Jury, as well as the Right to Open and Close the Evidence, belongs to the 
plaintiff, if he has anything to prove essential to his prima facie right of action; but it belongs to the defendant if 
there be no issue on the Allegations of the Declaration.’ 


In Criminal Cases, the prosecution always has the Opening and Closing Argument, and it may be given to the 
plaintiff in all Civil Actions by a Mere Rule of Practice, irrespective of his true position with respect to the Burden 
of Proof. This right to have the last word, after the opponent has been heard, with

and Closing the Case, as where he admits the due execution of a contract, but sets up the Affirmative Jetense of Discharge by Release; or by 
Operation of Law. Gardner v. Meeker, 109 Ill. 40, 48 N.E. 307 (1897); Nagle v, schnadt, 239 IIL 595, 58 N.E. 178 (1900); Gibson v, Reiselt,

no opportunity thereafter to explain, expose fallacies, or remove the spell of an emotional appeal, is regarded as 
giving a very distinct advantage to the side which acquires it. 


(ID The Opening Statement—Its Scope and Content.—As a preliminary to the introduction of the evidence, the 


plaintiff s counsel, or that side which has the Affirmative of the Issue, and from whom Proof is first required, has 
the right to make an Opening Statement. He briefly sets forth the issues of the ease as presented in the Pleadings, 


Page 568 of 735 


states what is admitted and what is disputed thereunder, gives an outline of the main points he expects to prove in 
support of his case, and attempts to show what bearing the evidence will have on the points he intends to establish. 
After this prologue, he then proceeds to call his Witnesses and to introduce his Documentary Evidence. 


The defendant may reserve his Opening Statement until after the close of the plaintiff's evidence, or it may be 
made immediately after the Opening Statement by the plaintiff, in order to place the issues before the Jury at the 
outset. 


The Evidence 

(I) Methods of Production- of Evidence.— The mode of offering testimony is generally by Witnesses who are 
present in Court and testify Orally before the Jury, though in all the states there are provisions under which, in 
certain circumstances, the evidence of Material Witnesses may be taken before the Trial, reduced to wrtting and 
certified by a proper Officer, and thus used at the Trial without the appearance of the Witnesses themselves, Where 
Witnesses testify Orally, they are first questioned by the Counsel for the Party producing them, which is called the 
“Direct Examination” or “Examination-in-Chief’, and then by the Opposing Counsel, which is called the “Cross- 
Examination,” and perhaps again by the former, which is known as the “Re-Direct Examination,” and by the 

latter, which is known as “Re-Cross Examination,” 


(ID The Examination of Witnesses: (A) The Oath of Witness ——When a Witness is called, before he takes his 
seat in the witness stand, the Clerk of the Court Administers the Oath that “the evidence that you shall give to the 
Court and Jury, touching the matters in question, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So 
help you God!” 


(B) The Direct Examin-ation,—The witness, having asserted to the Oath, the Counsel producing the Witness 
then proceeds with what is called the Direct Examination. He usually begins by asking the Witness his name, 
residence, business, and other preliminary matters, and then he proceeds to extract the desired information, He may 
do this either by plying the Witness with successive questions, or instead of requiring answers to specific 
questions, by permitting the Witness to tell his own story uninterrupted and unguided by questions from Counsel. 
The advantage of the second method is that it gives the opposition less opportunity to know beforehand what 
evidence is to be offered, and hence lessens the likelihood of the Examination being interrupted by captious 
objections, designed to weaken the impact of the evidence upon the minds of the Jurors.” 


It is the duty of the Court to exercise a reasonable control over the Mode of Examination and the Scope of the 
Evidence offered. Leading Questions, or questions so framed as to suggest to the Witness the desired answer, may 
elicit answers based on Counsel’s suggestion, rather than on the Witness’ own knowledge. Questions which 
obviously instruct the Witness as to the tenor of his reply, are, on this ground, generally objectionable. However, in 


dealing with a hostile Witness, as on Cross-Examination, the bias and 
19. On the art of examining a Witness on the Stand, 
see John C. Reed’s “The Conduct of Lawsuits.” 


546 
LITIGATING THE CONTROVERSY 
El. 2~. 
reluctance of the Witness removes much of the danger of suggestion from Leading Questions. It is proper for the 
Court or Jurors to put additional questions to elicit the facts upon which they desire fuller knowledge. 


(C) The Cross-Ex.amination.—Each Witness is not only subject to Direct Examination by the side which 
produced him; he is also subject to Cross-Examination by the opposite party, for the purpose of extracting his whole 
knowledge and to test its credit and significance before he leaves the stand. According to Dean Wigmore, a most 
distinguished authority in Evidence, “the belief that no safeguard for testing the value of human statements is 
comparable to that furnished by cross-examination, and the conviction that no statement(unless by special ex- 
ception) should be used as testimony until it has been probed and sublimated by that test, has found increasing 
strength in lengthening experience. Not even the abuses, the mishandlings, and the puerilities which are so often 
found associated with Cross-Examination have availed to nullify its value. It may be that in more than one sense it 
takes the place in our system which torture occupied in the mediaeval system of the civilians. Nevertheless, it is 
beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.” 20 


Page 569 of 735 


(D) The Advantages and Danger of CrossExamination.--—Cross-Examination is effective, because it 
exposes falsehood and inaccuracies, and beats out the truth, by disclosing the ability and willingness of the Witness 
to declare the truth, his opportunity to ascertain the facts, his powers of observation and memory, his situation and 
motives, and by fixing the Witness as to all the minute details of time and place. It is very difficult to make a 
fabricated story agree with all the circumstances. Truth alone will match all arOund. 


But Cross-Examination often is a two-edged 
sword, for it may extract the most unfavorable and damaging facts, confirming the opponent’s case, demonstrating 
the Witness’ credibility, or supplying fatal gaps which the opponent had left in his Proof. 


Methods of Withdrawing the Ca~se from the Jury 

AT Common Law, in the course of a Trial by Jury, the respective functions of the Judge and Jury were 
apportioned, the General Rule being that the Court decided the Law and the Jury the Facts, although this is not 
invariably true. From this practice, it follows logically that where the plaintiff failed to produce legally relevant 
evidence at the Trial, the matter might be withdrawn from the Jury. And the classic Common-Law procedural device 
for securing this end was the Demurrer to the Evidence. 


(I) The Demurrer to the Evidence:” 
(A) In GeneraL—A Demurrer to the Evidence is analogous to a Demurrer in Pleading, and it operates to 
withdraw a case from the Jury. It questions the sufficiency of the Evidence in Point of Law, and calls for the opinion 
of the Court upon the legal effect of the facts shown in evidence. And, for this purpose, it admits all the facts 
presented in the

evidence or which it conduces to prove.” If the plaintiff’ s evidence does not make a prima facie case, the defendant 
may Demur. But if he wishes to contradict it, he must resort to the Jury. 


This step is taken only in cases in which it is Very clear that the evidence has no tendency to prove the case; and 
naturally it is not often resorted to, for it is generally unsafe for a party to rest his case solely upon the test of what 
the evidence tends to prove—a matter often difficult to determine. The Party Demurring must obviously be the one 
holding the Negative of the Issue, as the result of the case must, as a General Rule, be in his favor, unless the 
Affirmative is proved against him. The effect of the proceeding is to determine the question whether the plaintiff’ s 
evidence shows a prima facie case or right of action.”* 


The Demurrer to the Evidence withdraws from the Jury the Application of the Law to the Facts, as in the case of 
a Special Verdict. On a Demurrer to the Evidence or Motion for Nonsuit, no Objection can be made to the 
Pleadings.”

dence has become obsolete.” It is superseded by a Motion for a Nonsuit or by a Motion to Direct a Verdict for the 
Defendant.’° 

On the Federal level the Supreme Court of the United States, in 1808 in the case of Pawling v. United States,” 
originally approved the rule as to admissions by Demurrer applied in the English case of Cocksedge v. 
Fans.haw, 25 to the effect that “by the Demurrer, the defendant admits every fact which the Jury could have found 
upon the evidence.” 29 But some five years later, in 1813, in the case of Young v. Black,” the Supreme Court, 
speaking through Mr. Justice Story shifted to the rule as enunciated in Gibson v. Hunter.” In that case, decided in 
1793, the Court held that where the testimony was oral and loose and indeterminate, or circumstantial, the plaintiff 
was not required to join in the Demurrer except where there was a specific admission in the Demurrer of every fact 
which the evidence conduced to prove. Thereafter, unless the plaintiff voluntarily joined in the Demurrer, the issue 
as to whether the Jury could have found the facts was no longer the subject of the inquiry; if the evidence at all 
conduced to prove the facts, those facts had to be admitted on the Record. This ruling was, in the words of Professor 
Thayer,” a

“death blow” to the Demurrer to Evidence in England. In consequence of this division of view as to the Demurrer to 
the Evidence in the United States Supreme Court, some States followed the more liberal rule of the Cocksedge 
Case, while others followed the stricter rule of the Gibson Case. Virginia developed an unorthodox view which 
included deferring the Demurrer until both Parties had completed their evidence.” This practice was adopted in 
West Virginia,” where it was further distorted by allowing the Court, in certain situations, to determine the 
sufficiency of the Demurrer on the preponderance of the evidence.” As thus modified, in Virginia and West 
Virginia, the Demurrer to the Evidence still flourished. In England, the place of its origin, by way of contrast, it has 
long since fallen into disuse.

Jury was by use of the procedural device known as a Nonsuit. At Common Law, a Nonsuit was not granted without 
the plaintiff’s consent, and the Court had no power to order a Nonsuit where the plaintiff insisted on a submission of 
a case to the Jury. But now, in many Jurisdictions, a Court may grant a Motion for a Nonsuit where the plaintiff s 
evidence fails to make out a p;’inic: facic case. 


Broadly speaking, a Nonsuit is a Judgment given against the plaintiff when he is unable to prove his case, or 
when he neglects or refuses to proceed to Trial. And Nonsuits are of two descriptions: 1. The Vountary Non-suit, 
which is an abandonment of his cause by the plaintiff either before the Trial is commenced, or during the 
presentation of his case; and 2. The Involuntary Nonsuit, which is a Judgment ordered by the Court where the 
plaintiff fails to appear, or where he has given no evidence on which a Verdict in his favor can be rendered.

case from the Jury isthe Directed Verdict, which is, in effect, the Modern Substitute for the Old Demurrer to the 
Evidence. The reason for this situation was that the Demurrer to the Evidence was highly technical and difficult to 
draft, as it was required to contain a full written statement of all the facts shown in evidence by the opposition Party, 
together with every reasonable inference favorable to the Party who presented the evidence.” Moreover, the use of 
the Demurrer was “an absolute, final and irrevocable withdrawal of the case from the Jury, which resulted 
necessarily in a Final Judgment on the merits for one party or the other.” ~ In consequence, one who had a 
meritorious Defense was reluctant to risk his whole case on one fling—the Demurrer to the Evidence.

Stenographer and in the memory of the Judge, such Motion, if sustained, results in a Verdict being directed by the 
Court, upon which is entered a Judgment on the merits; if overruled, the moving Party may still go on with the Trial, 
and seek a Verdict from the Jury.*° 


The Charge of the Court 

(I) JInstructions—Charging the J-ury— The Jury, in finding a General Verdict for Plaintiff or Defendant, must 
necessarily apply the Law to the Facts found; e.g., to decide whether or not they show a legal liability. Accordingly, 
after the Arguments, the Judge Orally Charges the Jury, and Jays down the Rules of Law which they are to apply to 
the Facts proved in rendering their Verdict for one or the other Party. The Judge will ordinarily state the Nature of 
the Action and Defense, the Points in Issue, what the plaintiff must prove to recover, and what rules will apply to the 
different states of fact which may possibly be established in the Opinion of the Jury. 


(ID Restrictions on the Charge.—At Common Law the Judge was under slight restraint in guiding the Jury. He 
could sum up the evidence, observing where the main issue lay, stating what evidence had been given to support it, 
and giving them his opinion on the credibility of the Witnesses and the weight and effect of the evidence—e.g., that 
the defendant’s case was a very “thin” one; but under our practice in the United States such comment, even if 
correct, would be regarded as an invasion of the Province of the Jury, and as such Reversible Error. The Judge 
cannot single out and disparage a Particular Witness, or express his belief or disbelief of certain testimony, or even 
make a comparison between direct and circumstan

tial evidence. It is almost universally provided that Judges may not Charge Juries with respect to Matters of Fact, but 
may sum up the testimony and Declare the Law. The Judge is not to state abstract principles of Law, but should state 
the Law concretely as applied to different conceivable theories of thc case, and instruct the Jury to find for the 
plaintiff or defendant according to one hypothesis or another. He may lay down the Rules by which the credibility of 
the Witnesses in general is to be judged, and where there is no Evidence or where a fact is admitted he may so state; 
but he cannot indicate his opinion as to what the Evidence proves, and the Jury is thus deprived of the benefit of his 
training and exuerience. 


(III) Requests to Charge—It is the duty of the Judge to Instruct the Jury, upon proper request, as to the correct 


decision, assuming any reasonable hypothesis in relation to the Facts in Evidence, and it is error for the Court to 
refuse any instruction which correctly Declares the Law, framed on a theory pertinent to the case. These requests 


Page 573 of 735 


may be presented to the Judge before or during Argument, but should be made in such time as will give the Judge 
opportunity to examine and pass upon them without delaying the Trial. There seems to bc no limitation on the 
number or length of the instructions which may be requested. Very few Lawyers are competent to write an elaborate 
Set of Instructions without committing errors which might conceivably mislead the Jury, and in the hurry of a Trial 
the ablest Judge may mistake the Law and misdirect the Jury; yet a Verdict for the plaintiff, obtained upon erroneous 
instructions, is practically worthless. This is one of the most serious abuses con. nected with Jury Trials. Exceptions 
for errors in giving, refusing, or modifying instructions should be taken before the retirement of the Jury, and should 
specifically point out the ones objected to. In some States excep 

tions may be entered at any time before Entry of Final Judgment. 


The Deliberations of the Jury 

THE Jury, after the Charge, unless the case be very clear, withdraws from the Ear to deliberate upon their 
Verdict. After the case was finally submitted to them, they could not separate, but were kept in charge of a Bailiff or 
Officer of the Court, duly sworn to attend them, but this is not always the case in Modern Practice. Ry the old 
English Practice they were to be kept without meat, drink, fire, or candle, unless by permission of the Judge, till they 
were unanimously agreed, a method of accelerating unanimity which is now given up. Formerly, if they did not 
agree in their Verdict before the Judges left town, they might be carried around the Circuit from town to town in a 
cart. Now, if it appears to the Court that they cannot agree, they are Discharged, and the case must be retried. The 
Court is not permitted to coerce the Jury into finding a Verdict, and should refrain from anything savoring of a threat 
as to how long the Jury will be kcpt together unless a Verdict is rendered.” 


The Verdict 

(D The General Verdict—Its Form and Tenor.—The Verdict, regardless of its character, must be responsive to 
the Issue submitted for Trial. At the Pleading Stage, in connection with the Development of the Common-Law 
Forms of Action, two inflexible rules of pleading grew up, one, that the Charge in the Declaration must correspond 
with the Charge in the Original Writ; two, that the Charge proved at the Trial must correspond with the Charge in 
the Declaration. It follows, therefore, that the Rule that the Issue found by the Verdict must cors, Alabama: DeJarnette v.

respond with the Issue submitted for Trial, is merely a continuation, at the Trial Stage, of the effort of the Common- 
Law Courts to maintain unity in their procedure. And, of course, the Judgment must correspond with the Issue as 
found by the Verdict. By these devices the procedure at Common Law, both in the Pleading and Trial Stages, was 
able to secure what, in English Composition, in relation to writing a paragraph, we refer to as unity and coherence. 


The General Verdict is in general terms, that is, merely “for the plaintiff’ or “for the defendant.” If it is returned 
for the plaintiff, it contains a Finding as to the Amount of Damages to which the Jury thinks him entitled, where 
Damages are claimed in the action. 


At Common Law, the Rule of Unanimity, made it essential that the Jurors must be in complete agreement as to the 
Verdict. After the Verdict was rendered, it was Entered on the back of the Nisi Prius Record) and was called the 
Postea (afterwards), from the name in Latin with which the recital began.

plaintiff has a cause of action, they then find for the plaintiff; if otherwise, then for the defendant. Such Special Ver- 
dict, rendered in lieu of a General Verdict, leaves it to the Court to Apply the Law to the Facts, and largely obviates 
the necessity for Instructions, whereas, under a General Verdict, the Jury is required to Apply the Law to Questions 
of Fact under the Instructions of the Court. 


At Common Law, it was entirely optional with the Jury to find Generally or Specially. If they returned a Special 
Verdict, setting forth their Findings of Fact, it concluded as follows: “that they (the Jury) are ignorant in Point of 
Law on which side they ought upon these Facts to find the Issue; that, if upon the whole matter the Court shall be of 
the opinion that the issue is proved for the plaintiff, they find for the plaintiff accordingly, and Assess the Damages 
at (a stated sum); but if the Court is of an opposite opinion, then vice versa.” Such Special Findings,

called a Special Verdict, hold the Jury to the line of duty, require orderly thought, and facilitate the granting of New 
Trials or adequate Appellate Review on separate and specific points. The situation in respect to the Special Verdict 
is like that when the Trial is by the Court, in which case the Judge is not permitted to make a General Finding of 
Fact and Law, as in a General Verdict, without separate findings on the particular issues raised. 


Under Modern Statutory Provisions, however, Special Questions, stating Each Point Separately, may be framed 
and submitted by the Court on request of Counsel, which the Jury must answer before their discharge, so that the 
true legal significance of Ascertained Facts may be declared by the Court. It is thus possible to see how the Facts are 
determined, whether the Law is properly applied, and how the Special Findings harmonize with the General 
Conclusion. 


(111) The Effect of a Variance Between the Charge and the Proof:—As observed above, the Verdict must 
be responsive to the Issue as made by the Pleadings and as submitted for Trial. It was, therefore, essential for the 
Party upon whom rested the Burden of Proof to establish by Adequate Proof the Substance of the Issue in his favor. 
Of course, if there was a Total Failure of Proof, it became the duty of the Jury to Find the Issue in favor of the 
opposite party. When, however, there was a discrepancy between what the plaintiff alleged in his Declaration and 
what he proved at the Trial, the discrep 
-ancy was called a Variance. Thus, if A alleged that B took his black horse, to which B pleaded Not Guilty, and at 
the Trial A offered evidence that B took his white horse, with a black front forefoot, B could Move for a Nonsuit on 
the ground of a Variance. Such 
-a Variance at Common Law was as fatal to the party bearing the Burden of Proof as if 
there were a Total Failure of Evidence, as the Jury is bound to find against him upon such discrepancy between the 
Issue and the Proof. 


Page 575 of 735 


(W) The Rule Nisi—After a Verdict at the Nisi Prius Trial, the Party against whom the Verdict has been rendered, 
may obtain a “RuJe Nisi,” as, for example, to set aside the Verdict and Enter a Nonsuit, which, in effect, is an Order 
by the Court to the Adverse Party to show cause why such relief should not be granted. Upon Motion and Argument 
of the question, if the Court grants the relief requested, it makes (as it is said) the Rule Absolute. If, however, the 
Court denies the Motion, it (as it is said) Discharges the Rule, which means that the party who obtained the Rule 
Nisi should obtain nothing. 


(V) A Special Case, or Reservation of a Point—Whether a Jury shall return a General or Special Verdict is 
a matter entirely in its own option. The party objecting in Point of Law cannot therefore insist on a Special Verdict, 
hence he may be compelled to Demur to the Evidence, if he desires to make the objection a Matter of Record, 
without which no Review may be had on Writ of Error. If, however, his object be merely to obtain a deeision in the 
Court in bane at Westminster, he need neither Demur to the Evidence, nor take a Special Verdict, but merely take a 
General Verdict, subject, as it is said, to a Special Case. 


A Special Case is a written statement of all the Facts proved at the Trial, drawn up for the opinion of the Court in 
bane. It is usually drawn up by the Counsel and Attorneys on either side, under the direction of the Judge at £1183 
prius. The Party for whom the General Verdict is given, is not entitled to Judgment until the Court in bane has 
decided the Special Case. According to the result of that decision, the Verdict is ultimately entered for hint or his 
adversary.

Ch. 26 

of Fact sufficiently Pleaded on the other side, it cannot be said, e converso, that it is the effect of a Pleading to 
admit the sufficiency in Law of the Facts adversely alleged. On the contrary, it has been seen that, upon a Demurrer 
arising at a later Stage of the Pleading, the Court will retrospectively consider the sufficiency in Law of Matters to 
which an answer in Fact has been given. And it has also been shown that, even after an Issue of Fact and Verdict 
thereon, the Court is bound to give Judgment on the whole record, based upon an examination of the legal 
sufficiency of all Allegations, throughout the whole series of the Pleadings. It follows, therefore, that advantage may 
be often taken by either party of a legal insufficiency in the Pleading of the other side, either by Motion in Arrest of 
Judgment, Motion for Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto, or Writ of Error, according to the circumstances of the 
Case, although he has answered instead of Demurring, provided the Case is not one within the exceptions above 
noted, and which will now be explained; that is, provided the fault is not cured by the subsequent Pleading, or cured 
or Aided by Verdict, or by a Statute requiring the objection to be raised at a particular Stage of the Proceeding. 


AIDER BY PLEADING OVER: 
WITHOUT VERDICT 


298. If the party wishes to Plead, instead of Demurring, and still preserve his right of objection to a defective adverse 
Pleading, he must so frame his own Pleading as to avoid waiver of such defects by the formation of a complete issue. A 
defect in Pleading is Aided if the adverse party Plead Over to or answer the defective Pleading in such a manner that an 
informality or omission therein is supplied or rendered formal or intelligible. A defect of this character may be thus 
supplied either: 

(I) Expressly, or 


(IM) By Implication. 


Aider Defined 
ASSUMING that a Pleading is either formally or substantially defective, any subse 

quent Act in the course of the litigation which supplies, waives or otherwise rectifies the error in the Pleading, 
whether it be one 

eof Commission or omission, is an Aider. Thus, for example, to maintain an Action of Trover the plaintiff must 
allege Possession or Right to Immediate Possession, Wrongful Act of Conversion and Damages. Suppose, however, 
he omits the Allegation as to Possession or Right to Immediate Possession. If, at the next succeeding Stage of 
Pleading, the defendant, by his Plea, supplies the missing Allegation of Possession or Right to Immediate 


Page 577 of 735 


Possession, the defect in the plaintiff s Declaration is said to be Aided or cured. 


The Modes of Aider were five in number, three of which operated in advance of any Verdict and independent 
thereof, whereas two came into play after Verdict and only by reason of the Verdict. For purpose of discussion, 
therefore, we may say that we have two types of Aider, to wit, Aider without Verdict and Aider by Verdict’ 


Aider Without Verdict—By Subsequent Pleading 
PRIOR to a Verdict and independent of a Verdict, defects in a Pleading may be cured in one or more of three 
possible ways, the Mode of Aider being dependent upon the character of the defect. 


(I) By Pleading Oven—As we have seen, after the Statute of Elizabeth (1585) and the Statute of Anne (1705), 
all Defects in Form not made the subject of a Special Demurrer were Aided. If the Adverse Party failed to Demur at 
all or entered a General Demurrer, or Pleaded over Matter of Fact, he automatically waived the Formel Defect in the 
Pleading and thereafter could not take advantage of such insufficiency upon any Demurrer at

any Subsequent Stage of the Pleadings,’ and obviously not after Verdict. In the Anon ynzaus case, Holt, Chief 
Justice, in referring to Objections in Form, said that “if a man Pleads Over, he shall never take advantage of any 
slip committed in the Pleading of the other side, which he could not take advantage of upon a General 
Demurrer.” ~ 


(ID By Express Averment .—Where a Substantive Allegation of Fact is Omitted from a Declaration or Other 
Pleading, and in the Next Succeeding Stage in Pleading is supplied by the Adverse Party, such subsequent 
statement operates to cure the Defect in the Original Pleading. Thus, in the famous case of Brooke v. Brooke,” A 
brought Trespass for taking a hook, but failed to allege possession. B Pleaded that while going over A’s land, over 
which he had a right of way, he met A and took the hook out of his hands. On Motion in Arrest of Judgment, the 
Court held that the defendant by his Special Plea had cured the Declaration by supplying the Missing Allegation of 
Possession. And so, in La-

But although waiving Avcrments otherwise necessary, it does not dispense with Proof of Material Allegations. Ohio & M. B. B. Co. v. 
Brown, 23 In. 93 (1859). 


fayette Jn$. Go, v. Frenclv,’ a Declaration which failed to affirmatively show the Jurisdiction of the Court, was 
cured by a Replication which contained the necessary Averments. Likewise, a Defective Plea may be cured by the 
required Allegation in the Replication.* 


Page 578 of 735 


(IID) By Implied Admission,s.—An Answering Pleading may actually supply a De-~ fect or Omission by Express 

Allegation of the Fact which should have been stated, or it may contain an Implied Admission, correcting the 
Informality by waiving it.” Thus, where the plaintiff sues as a corporation, Alleging due incorporation according 
to the Laws of the State wherein it was organized, and the defendant Pleads to the merits without raising any 
question as to the Authority of the Plaintiff to Sue, the defendant’s Plea implies that the plaintiff is entitled to 
Sue in the Capacity of a Corporation, and any imperfection in the plaintiff's Authority will, in some States at 
least, be deemed to be waived. And likewise where a plaintiff purports to Sue as a Personal Representative, that 
is, as an Administrator or Executor. And a General Allegation of a “good and valuable consideration” in the 
Contract Field, or that the plaintiff was injured “by the negligent operation of the defendant’s engine’, in the 
Tort Field, may be waived by a General Demurrer, or taken advantage of upon a Special Demurrer; but if the 
Adverse Party fails to Demur for insufficiency, or to take Issue upon an Ill-Pleaded Allegation, and Pleads to 
other Facts stated in the Pleading, the Il-Pleaded Fact will stand Admitted by Implication as a result of ignoring 
it and taking Issue upon a Collateral Matter. But no such Implied Ad 18 flow. 404, 15 LEd. 451 (1855).

mission will operate to cure a Defect in Substance.’° Such an Omission must be Expressly Supplied.” 

In cases where Defects have been supplied by Implication, the passing over of such Insufficient Averment, plus 
the Pleading to a Collateral Matter, has been said to be Aided by Verdict under the Statutes of Jeofails, and, 
according to Keigwin,” where there is a Verdict, the Courts seem to have a preference for putting the Aider upon 
those Statutes, as if the curative effect of such Pleading was of Statutory Origin. But, says Professor Keigwin, “in 
Buckland v. Otley, E .-. although there was a Verdict, the Declaration was said to be made good by the Mere Pleading of 
a Collateral Plea; and in Cutler v. Southern, there was no Verdict at all, and the bad Pleading as to Cook’s Suit 
was held on Demurrer to be waived by the defendant’s Pleading to something else. These and some like cases appear 
to establish the principle 

-. that a Defect may be Waived by Pleading to a Collateral Matter, and this upon the theory of an Implied 
Admission, and without the Aid of a Verdict or of Statutes which require a Verdict for their operation.”

be intended that Due Proof was made at the Trial of any Fact which, though Ill-pleaded, was so far a part of the Issue as 
made by the Pleadings that the Verdict rendered could not have been found without such Evidence of the Facts 
Insufficiently Alleged as is necessary to establish completely the validity of their existence; and by virtue of the 
presumption thus raised, the Verdict operates to cure or Aid the Defective Allegation so that any Deficiency therein 
cannot he seized upon to Arrest the Judgment. 


A VERDICT is rendered by a Jury, Impaneled and sworn for the Trial of a Cause, upon which Evidence is 
presented by Both Parties, and it is reported to the Court, upon Issues duly submitted to the Jury upon the Trial. As a 
result of the Trial, on the basis of Evidence presented, the ease as presented by the Pleadings may be supplemented. 
Thus, the Evidence may supply matters not previously disclosed, make clear Facts which were left in doubt by the 
Allegations in the Pleadings, and clarify other Issues not clearly presented in the Pre-Trial Proceedings. Under such 
circumstances certain Deficiencies in the Pleadings may be Aided by a Verdict, operating by either one of Two 
Methods, which are diverse in character. In one situation the remedial effect of the Verdict is the result of the 
Common Law Principle of Intendment After Verdict; in the other the Aider by Verdict flows directly from the effect 
of a Series of Statutes, known as the Statutes of Jeofails. Aider by the Common Law Principle of Intendment after 
Verdict, and Aider by virtue of the Statutes of Jeofails, constitute the Fourth and Fifth Modes of Aider, which will 
now be considered in their respective order, 


Aider by the Common Law Principle of Intendment After Verdict 
WHERE, iii setting forth a Cause of Action or a Defense, as the case may be, a Pleader fails to allege a Fact 


sufficiently or to adequately state a right, no presumption arises to validate his Fact or to complete his right. 
Sec. 299 

AIDER AND AMENDMENT 

557 

In fact, as the Pleader is presumed to tell his side of the controversy in the light most f avorable to himself, the 
presumption is that any failure to sufficiently state what is essential to make out his case is to be attributed to the 
circumstance that the Omitted Facts did not exist. However, in the case of Hitchin v. Stevens,” where the 
purchaser of a reversion brought an Action of Debt for rent, but alleged no attornment, the defendant pleaded Nil 
Debet, and there was a Verdict for the plaintiff, whereupon the defendant Moved in Arrest of Judgment on the 
ground that the plaintiff had insufficiently set forth his title to the rent, having failed to allege an attornment, the Court 
held that in any case where anything is Omitted in a Declaration, even though it be Matter of Substance, '® if it be such 
as, without proving it at the Trial, the Court could not have had a Verdict, and there be a Verdict for the plaintiff, 
such Omission shall not Arrest the Judgment. Accordingly, Judgment was Entered for time plaintiff. The Verdict 
thus placed the case in a different light; the Fact of Title having been imperfectly alleged, because of 


15.2 Show.K.B. 233, 89 Eng.Rop. 909 (1682). 


16. But compare Da costa v. Clarke, 2 B. & P. 257, 
126 Eug.Rep. 1265 (1500), where the court held that an imperfect Averment of a Material Fact was not Aided by Verdict in favor of the 
pleader In such a case, before the Rule can operate, there must be a sufficient Averment to serve as a peg to hang the omitted matter on, [See 
opinion of Buluer, J., in Spiers v. Parker, 1 T.R. 141, 99 Eng.Rep. 1019 (1786)1, or, stated otherwise, there must be at least a partial statement 


of a substantive fact before any presumption will arise that the circumstances requisite to a complete statement were in reality proved at the 
Trial. 


For an instructive statement and application of the principle, see Wills v. Claflin, 92 U.S. 135, 23 LEd. 490 (1875). See, also, Alabama: Contorno 
v. Ensley CO., 211 Ala. 211, 100 So. 127 (1924); Illinois: 
Miller v. Kresge Co., 309 II. 104, 137 N.E. 385 (1922); New York: Sherwood v. Chace, 11 Wend, (N.Y.) 381 (1833). 


And for an exhaustive discussion of this topic, with citation of many authorities, see State v. Freeman, 
63 Vt. 496, 22 AU. 621 (1891). 


failure to show attornment, was nevertheless put in Issue so that its truth had to be tried, and on the basis of the 
evidence as presented at the Trial, the Fact of Title was found in favor of the plaintiff. From this flowed a 
presumption that at the Trial the plaintiff Proved the Allegations, though not correctly stated, which were essential to 
make out the Ultimate Fact of Title. 


To the Common Law Principle of Intendment After Verdict there were two limitations: 


(Œ) Where There is no Peg to Hang the Omitted Matter On.—Where the Defective Pleading sought to be 


Page 580 of 735 


Aided by Verdict under the Principle of Intendment contains no Averment at all, imperfect or otherwise, of the 
Ultimate Fact required to establish the Pleader’s Case, no presumption can arise that the Fact was proved, and it 
follows logically that the Verdict cannot Aid the Complete Omission. The same idea has frequently been expressed 
in the statement that a Verdict will cure a Defective Statement of a Good Title, but not the Statement of a Defective 
Title; in other words, as Professor Keigwin observed: “The Verdict will supplement an Incomplete Pleading, but will 
not supply a Total Want of Averment.” 17 Although one who alleges an imperfect case is entitled to a Verdict if he 
proves the Facts as alleged, obtaining a Verdict affords no presumption that he has proved what he has failed to 
allege at least by implication, or to some extent by suggestion - Thus, in the case of Buxendin v. Sharp)? where the 
plaintiff alleged that the

But see, Skinner v, Gunton, 1 Wins. Saund. 229, 85 Engilep. 249 (169W, in which it was held that a Declaration in case for Malicious 
Prosecution, which omitted an Allegation that the former proceeding had ended, was Aided by a Verdict for the plaintiff. But a failure to 
allege want of probable cause constitutes a substantive defect, and hence presumably would not be Aided by Verdict. Dennehey v. Woodsum,

defendant kept a bull that ran at and injured the plaintiff, but failed to allege that the plaintiff had knowledge of the 
bull’s dangerous propensities, the Defect was held not Aided after Verdict, as the Action would not lie unless the 
master knew of this quality, and there could be no Inteiidment that it was Proved at the Trial, as the plaintiff was 
under no obligation to prove more than he alleged.’° 


(Il) Where There is a Peg to Hang Omitted Matter on, but the Matter Inadequately Allcgcd is not Pleaded in 
such a way as to Become a Part of the Issue.—Where the Ill-pleaded Fact is not Traversed, or otherwise Pleaded in 
such a way as to becolne a part of the Issue actually produced by the Pleadings, such Fact, not being in Issue, need 
not be Proved at the Trial. Under such circumstances the Verdict raises no presumption that the Ill-pleaded Fact was 
made effective by the evidence produced at the Trial. For example, if in a Declaration in Special Assumpsit, the 
Consideration is Defectively Alleged, and the defendant Pleads the Statute of Limitations, since No Issue is taken on 
the Fact of Consideration, no Proof is required, and hence a Verdict for the plaintiff does not Aid the Defective 
Statement of the Consideration on the theory that the evidence at the Trial supplied any Omitted Element. Cases of 
this charactel’ therefore do not fall within the scope of the Common Law Principle of Intendment after Verdict. It 
may be, however, that such cases may fall within the purview of that series of Remedial Enactments known as the 
Statutes of Jeofails. 


THE STATUTES OF JEOFAILS 


300. Asa result of the English Statutes of Jeofails, beginning in 1340 and extending down to Modern Times, there 
has been a gradual liberalization of the earlier strict policy against permitting Free Amendments of Pleadings, 


19. English: Jackson v. Pesked, 1 M. & 8. 234, 105 Eng.Jlep. 88 (1513); Alabama: Douglas v. Beasley, 40 Ala. 142 (1866); Illaois: Chicago & 
A. R. Co. v. Clausen, 173 Ill. 100, 50 N.E. 680 (1898). 


AFTER the appearance of Written Pleadings, and after the proceedings in any given 
case were Entered on Record, at Common Law, or prior to the grant of Statutory Authority, the Courts would permit 
no further Amendments. This resulted in many litigants losing their cases when they were clearly entitled to win as a 
matter of substance. They were accordingly left without remedy. To meet this situation Parliament gradually began 
to provide a piecemeal remedy in a series of Enactments now known as the Statutes of Jeofails. Most of the ensuing 
Statutes, enacted between the years 1340 and 1705, applied to Errors which called for correction after Trial, but two 
of them, the Statute of Elizabeth (1585) and the Statute of Anne (1705), applied to the Record before Verdict. 


According to Plucknett,”° efforts to improve the System of Special Pleading, which tended to become more rigid 
as time went on, by the Enactment of Statutes of Jeofails, began in the early Fourteenth Century. And Professor 
Samuel Tyler, in his Preface to Ste~ phen,” stated: “No less than Tsvelve Statutes, beginning in the Reign of 
Edward III [1327-4377], and coming down to that of George I [1714—1727], had been passed by Parliament before

we separated from England, to remedy tcchnical inconveniences.” 


AMENDMENTS 


30L A party will generally be allowed to correct Inaccuracies or Supply Omissions in 
his Pleadings by Amendment at any time before the Jury have retired, if he has not been guilty of Ladies in applying 
for leave to Amend, and if the Amendment does not change the Form of Action, or introduce a New Cause of Action or 
Ground of Defence, or prejudice the Adverse Party.

21- Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions. Preface, (3d Au. cd. by Tyler, Washington. D. C. 1000). 

THE Court will generally allow an Amendment to correct Mistakes in the Names of the Parties,” or to strike out 
Parties Improperly Joined,” or bring in Parties Improperly Omitted, or who have become Necessary Parties since 
Commencement of the Suit,” or to correct the Pleading as to the Capacity in which a Party Sues or is Sued.” And an 
Amendment is frequently allowed in order to Conform the Pleadings to the Proof that has been offered, so as to 
avoid a Vanancé, where no prejudice to the Opposite Party can result. 


It is always safer to apply for Leave to Amend before Issue Joined, or at least before the Thal has Commenced, 
for the Court may refuse to allow an Amendment after that time.*° A Party cannot insist upon a right to Amend if he 
has been guilty of Laches.” The Court may, however, in the exercise of its discretion, allow Amendments at any time 
before the Jury have retired, if it properly protects the Other Party,” and some Amend-merits, as Amendments to 
Conform to Proof, may be allowed after Verdict, and even after Judgment.”°

Amendments to Ciwn-ge the Form of Action UNDER the Common Law a plaintiff was 

not permitted to Amend his Declaration if it operated to change the Form of the Action, as from Assumpsit to 
Covenant, or from Case to Trespass.” There was a sensible reason for such a holding. The Rule was that the Charge 
in the Declaration had to conform to the Charge in the Original Writ as issued out of Chancery. If there was a Vari- 
ance between the two, it was ground for a Plea in Abatement. Thus, if A sued out an Original Writ in Debt, his 
Declaration was but an Amplification of the Charge of Debt as set forth in the Writ. Naturally, an attempt to Amend 
his Declaration to Covenant would be Error, as Covenant did not fall within the scope of the Charge of Debt as 
Stated in the Original Writ. Nor could such a Defect be waived by agreement of the Parties.”! Even where an 
Amendment would otherwise be permissible, it should not be allowed if it would result in prejudice to the Ad-

In some States the Rule is changed by Statute, or is not recognized. See Redstrake v. Cumberland Slut. Fire Ins. Co., 44 NIL. 294 (1882), where 
an Amendment was allowed, changing the Form of Action from Assumpsit to Covenant: Connecticut: North

verse Party.” And always, when it is allowed, the Court may and should impose such terms as will fully protect the 
Adverse Party, such as payment of Costs of the Application, and, in some cases, Costs of the Whole Suit up to the 
time of the Amendment. 


The Situation Under Modern Law as to Amendment Changing the Form of Action- 

IN England, as earlier observed, as long as the Original Writ operated, an Amendment changing the Form of 
Action was fatal. But with the abolition of the Original Writ in 1833,~~ Amendments were permitted in the 
discretion of the Court. In New Hampshire, in the case of Stebbins v. Lancashire Ins. Co.,** the Court followed 
this liberal English view, but in the Several States of the United States, despite the fact that Original Writs were not 
used, Amendments changing the Form of Action have been frequently disallowed.” 


With the abolition of the Forms of Action after 1848, all reasons for observing the Rule prohibiting Amendments 
changing the Form of Action ceased to exist, and it would seem that the Code States might have followed the liberal 
view in pennitting amendments. But according to Professor Scott, “this rule was replaced by one which is even 
worse.” It was held that an Amendment could not be allowed if it changed the Cause of Action. 

“This is in many ways a more sweeping limitation upon the power of the Court than the Common-Law Rule.” ~ 
Fortunately, this departure from the ways of Good Pleading was

met by Statutory Repudiation in Several States.” In some States, under a liberal policy of Amendment, Amendments 
were permitted by which an Action at Law could be changed into a Suit in Equity, or a Suit in Equity into an Action 
at Law. This was provided for in Wisconsin under its Code.** As Winslow, J. said, in Jilek v. Zahi? in referring to the 
purpose of the Wisconsin Statute: “The beneficent effect of this provision can hardly be overestimated. It means that ft 
will no longer be necessary to kick the plaintiff out the back door of the Courtroom (with Costs) in order that he may 
re-enter by the front door in a different garb.” 


Amendment and the Statute of Limitations IF an Amendment imtroduces into the Declaration a New and 
Different Cause of Action from the One Originally Stated, it is subject to a Plea of the Statute of Limitations, if the 
Statutory Period had run against the claim. And this is true although the Statute had not run at the time the Original 
Action began. But obviously Amendments should be allowed which do not introduce a New Cause of Action, but 


Page 583 of 735 


where the Allegations merely amplify or vary the claim set up in the Original Count, md this is true even where 
Essential Elements are added.’° 


The ‘question of the running of the Statute of Limitations and the right to Amend the Declaration thereafter should 
never turn upon the question whether the Declaration states a Good Cause of Action. The correct test should be 
whether the Commencement of the Action constituted fair notice of the assertion of that particular claim.

But the Law in Illinois has been otherwise. 
The Statute of Limitations continued to run 


in spite of a Defective Declaration. In the case of Walters v. City of Ottawa,” an Action was brought against the 
City for personal injuries due to a defective sidewalk, in which the Declaration failed to state that Formal Notice had 
been given as required by Statute. The City Pleaded the General Issue, but later withdrew this Plea and filed a 
Demurrer, which was sustained. Thereupon the plaintiff Amended her Declaration 

by adding to each Count Averments showing the giving of the Notice in due season, Now, the City again Pleaded 
the General Issue and added a Plea of the One-Year Statute of Limitations. A Verdict of $1,000 was rendered 
against the City, but on Review by the Supreme Court, the Judgment which had been Entered was Reversed, the 
Court holding that an Amendment to the Declaration supplying such Essential Averments more than a year after the 
injury was open to a Plea of the Statute of Limitations.”

The Statute of Limitations, under this view, continues to run until a good Cause of Action with all Essential Facts is stated, and, if at that time, it 
has run, it will operate as a Bar to a New Cause of Action stated in the Amended Count, Allis-Chalmers Mi g. Co. v. City of Chicago, 297 Ill.

rate Cause of Action. And Amendment after the Limitation Period is permissible, although the Declaration was 
Demurrable, where it perfects the Same Cause of Action Originally Pleaded. That is the only sort of Amendment 
that is really important.” It is well settled that the Statute of Limitations is no Bar to an Amendment of the Declara- 
tion as to non-essentials.*”

Amendments With or Withont Leave of the Court 


UNDER the Code Provisions, as exemplified by Rule 3025(a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, a 
Pleading, without Leave of the Court, may once be Amended by the Party as “of course,” within the time fixed in 
the Rule. But, under a number of Codes, if it appears that the Amendment was for the purpose of delay and that the 
Adverse Party will be prejudiced, the Amended Pleading may be stricken out, on such Terms as the Court may deem 
just. And Some State Statutes have provided in effect that the Court may permit Amendment of Any Pleading by 
addng or striking out the irnine of Any Party, or by correcting a Mistake in any other respect; or, provided the 
Amendment does not substantially change the Claim or Defense, by Conforming the Pleading to the Facts proved.” 


Federal Rule 15(b) provides that when Issues not raised by the Pleadings are tried by express or imphed consent 
of the Parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the Pleadings. Moreover, even After 
Judgment, a Party may upon Motion Amend his Pleadings to Conform to the Evidence, and failure to so Amend 
does not affect the result of the Trial of these Issues. And where there is an Offer of Evidence which is objected to at 
trial on the ground that it is not within the Scope of the Issues as Made by the Pleadings, the Court may allow the 
Pleadings to be Amended where the Merits of the Action will be subserved and the Objecting Party fails to satisfy 
the Court 


ES. Jbl& 
that the admission of such evidence woult prejudice him.” 


Certain States attempted to Regulate th Form of Amendments. Oregon, for example required an Amended 
Pleading to be com plete in itself, aside from the Original Plead~ ing; - some States required Motions to be in 
writing and to specifically set forth the words sought to be inserted or stricken out; -° and in at least one State 
Amendment was not permitted to be made by erasure or interlineatlon, a separate paper being required to be filed, 
and when so filed, to constitute with the Original but a Single Pleading. In the absence of statutory requirement, the 
Form of an Amendment lies within the discretion of the Court In Some States it was required that the Application for 
Amendment be accompanied by Affidavit stating the reasons therefor.”!

Amendments Changing the Cau~se of Action 

AS we have seen in the earlier discussion of this subject as it stood at Common Law, with the abolition of the 
Original Writ in England in 1833 and the Forms of Action in New York in 1843, the reasons for not permitting an 
Amendment changing the Form of Action ceased to operate. 


In the Code States where the Statute Regulating Amendment does not in specific terms restrict the power, it would 
appear that such unrestricted power should extend far enough to permit an Amendment changing the Cause of 
Action. The situation is, however, more restrictive where under the Statute a Court has power to Conform the Plead-

ings to the Proof only “when the Amendment does not change substantially the Claim or Defense.” 


In the Federal Courts, first, a liberal view as to Amendments was taken.” Second, due to the case of Union P. 1?. 

Co. v. ~y7er;~ in which an employee of a railroad was not permitted to shift his claim for Damages from the 
Common Law to a Kansas Statute, a stricter view was assumed, the Court indicating that a “Departure from Law to 
Law” was not permissible. Third, in the more recent case of Missouri, K. c~ T. 
H. Co. v. Wulf,~ the trend again turned in the direction of liberality, where a Claim Under a Kansas Statute was, 
as a result of Amendment, converted to a Suit under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. Instead of finding a New 
Cause of Action, the Court said the change was merely in Form and Not in Substance, In the process of 
development, the Federal Courts made clear that they had abandoned the restrictive “Law to Law” rule, and when 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted, they contained no such restriction.~ It may be said, therefore, 
that the earlier policy of restricting the Power of Amendment has lost favor, with the Courts generally accepting the 
broader concept of the Cause of Action as 


consisting of a Group of Operative Facts. The “Law to Law” test was abandoned in New York as early as 1872,~ 
and Other States have followed her leadership.” New York

also led in establishing a liberal rule as to Amendments by a defendant, the Court in Bowman v. DePeyster, sa 


referring to the greater liberality afforded to Amendments by a defendant at Common Law, declaring:

the benefit of it.” 


Ar,wndinents and the Statute of Limitations 

SOME of the State Courts take the view that where an Amendment to the Complaint sets up a New Cause of 
Action, and in the meantime the Statute of Limitations has run against such Action, the Action is Barred as the 
Amendment does not relate back.” Other State Courts take the view that such an Amendment is merely an 
Amplification of the Same Action, provided it refers to the same Group of Operative Facts, broad enough in scope to 
support the New Cause of Action. Changes in legal theory should be ignored in determining the Issue. Under the 
Federal Rules,” unless there has been a material change in the Operative Facts, an Amendment should be allowed.”

Aider 
THE Codes have not made great changes in the Common-Law Doctrine of Aider in its Various Forms, as 
previously discussed. Thus, the principle enunciated in Birooke v. Broolce,~ the famous hook Case, that a Defect in 
the Plaintiff's Declaration may be cured or supplied by a Subsequent Plea, applied under the Codes,~ although it has 
been qualified in Some States by the Rule that a Defect cannot be supplied by a Mere Denial.~

When we come to Aider by Verdict, it may be said that for most part the Common-Law Rules still prevail. Thus, 
the famous, but not very enlightening Rule that a Defectively Alleged Cause of Action may be cured by Aider, but 
not the Statement of a Defective Cause of Action, still prevails, In general, however, mere Defects in Form are 
waived by a failure to Move or Demur. Defects of a more serious character may be waived if not raised until after 
Verdict or Judgment. But, as Judge Clark observes, “if a System of Written Pleadings is to be enforced, there will 
necessarily remain a Class of Cases where the Court will feel that the Pleadings have not served their purpose of 
bringing out the Cause of Action even in a general fashion.” 65

Variance 
THE situation where there is a Variance between the Allegations in the Complaint and the Proof at the Trial, is 
now covered in the Codes by a Statutory Provision, of which an example is Rule 3025(c) of the New York Civil 
Practice Law and Rules, which provides: “Tile Court may permit Pleadings to be Amended before or after Judgment 
to Conform them to the Evidence, upon such terms as may be just including the granting of costs and continuances.” 


Defective Pleadings Aided by Statute 

THE related Section 2001 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, covering Mistakes, Omissions, Defects 
and Irregularities in Pleading, provides: “At Any Stage of an Action, the Court may permit a Mistake, Omission, 
Defect or Irregularity to be corrected, upon such terms as may be just, or, if a substantial right of a party is not preju- 
diced, the Mistake, Omission, Defect or Irregularity shall be disregarded.” 


Supplemental Pleadings 

SUPPLEMENTAL Pleadings, as provided for in Statutory Provisions, are usually restricted to a Statement of 
Facts which occurred after the Filing of the Original Pleading by the Party. In this sense such Pleadings, strictly 
speaking, are not Amendments. But they may well fall within this class under those Code Provisions which permit 
Supplemental Pleadings to set forth Facts which existed, but of which the Pleader had no knowledge, when the 
Original Pleading was Filed. In any event, the Allowing of such Pleadings, like Amendments, is largely a matter for 
the discretion of the Court, and the measure of their allowance ought to be whether they result in general in the 
Furtherance of Justice.°°

303. As the Retrospective Motions for a New Trial, for Venire Facias De Novo, for Arrest of Judgment, for 
Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, and for a Repleader, come after Verdict and before Judgment, it is essential to 
understand that Judgment does not immediately follow Rendition of a Verdict. It is suspended for a short period of time 
to permit the Losing Party at the Nisi Prius Trial to examine the Pleadings in order to determine whether the Matters 
Alleged by the Prevailing Party are sufficient to sustain a Judgment on the Verdict, and to examine the Conduct of the 
Trial with reference to rulings of the Court and other conduct which might invalidate the Verdict.

Verdict on that Issue, it would seem that a Judgment according to the Verdict should ordinarily be Entered.” 
Frequently, however, an Error by Either One or Both Parties, prevents a presentation of the Issue on the Pleadings in 
such a manner so as to make possible a decision of the controversy, or it may be that an Error on the Part of the 
Court may result in a failure to correctly determine the Issue as made by the Pleadings. Thus, for example, if A sues 
B in Case for Slander, alleging that B spoke of and concerning A, stating that A is a liar, A is not entitled to recovery, 
even though a Jury finds the Facts as A alleged, if the alleged statement is derogatory language which, as a Matter of 
Substantive Law, is not actionable even ii proven. And if, by Way of Defense, B alleges that he was merely 
repeating what someone else said, this Fact, if true, constitutes No Defenre as a Matter of Substantive Law. In either 
case a Verdict by the Jury would not constitute a sufficient basis to war-

rant a Judgment. As a Verdict is therefor not necessarily decisive of the Cause, th Court, in considering an 

appropriate Motior should thoroughly examine the Pleadings fo: 

the purpose of ascertaining whether the Fact: 

alleged by the victorious Party will sustain Judgment in his favor. And in some caset the conduct of the Trial may 

have to be considered, particularly with reference to th Rulings of the Court on offers and rejections of evidence, 

some of which may operate to invalidate a Verdict. To meet these even~ tualities and to give an opportunity for the 
losing party to examine the Record and the Trial, at Common Law the Entry of the Judgment was delayed. This 
resulted in English Practice from the circumstance that Nisi Prius Trials were usually held out on the Circuit away 
from Westminster, during a Vacation of the Court, and therefore the Record Roll, with the Entry of the Verdict, 
could not be presented to the Full Court for Judgment, until after the Commencement of the Next Term. Within four 
days after the Court met En Bane at Westminster. the Losing Party at the Nisi Prius Trial was permitted any Motion 

seeking to avoid the Judgment which in the normal course of affairs would logically follow upon a Verdict.’ A 

similar Rule has usually been followed in the American Courts, except where changed by Rule of Court or Statute.-' 

The effort to avert the Entry of Judgment on the Verdict took the Form of One or More Motions, which, as Professor 

Keigwin observes, “because they look backward over the course of the proceeding, may be called Retrospective 

Motions,” ~ which were Five in

With the exception of the First Motion, all proceed upon the theory of taking advantage of some Defect 
Apparent Upon the Face of the Common Law Record. The Motion for a New Trial seeks to reach Errors 


Page 590 of 735 


sO 


which lie Outside that Record, and which can be shown 
without reference to the Roll. 


MATTER OF RECORD VERSUS 
MATTER OF EXCEPTION 


304.Four out of five of the Retrospective Motions are addressed to Errors Apparent Upon the Face of the 
Common-Law Record. The 
e Common-Law Record consists of the Process, the Pleadings, the Verdict and the Judgment. After Judgment, such 
Errors were Reviewable 
by Writ of Error. Errors which occurred at the Trial were not part of the Common-Law Record, and could be 
Reviewed by a Motion for a New Trial, after Verdict and before Judgment; by Statute, such Errors could be 
Reviewed after judgment by incorporating them into the Record by means of a Bill of Exceptions. It was 
therefore essential to keep clearly in mind the distinction between Matter of Record and Matter of Exception. 


UNDER the ancient practice, the Proceed-ings in a litigated case were Entered upon 
the Parchment Roll, and when this was 
completed, the end product became known as 


the Common-Law Record. It consisted of Four Parts, the Process, which included the 
Original Writ and the Return of the Sheriff, by which the Court acquired Jurisdiction over 
the defendant; the Pleadings, presented by the Parties in the prescribed order to develop an Issue of Law or of Fact, 
and which included the Declaration and all subsequent Pleadings, together with the Demurrers, if any; the 
Verdict; and the Judgment, These Four Elements formed the Common-Law Record, but it should be 
observed that at the point where the Retrospective Motions come into 
567 


play, the Record has not been developed beyond the Stage of Entering the Verdict upon the Roll. 


At this point it should also be recalled that between the time when the Pleadings Terminated in an Issue, which 
Joinder in Issue was duly Recorded on the Parchment Roll, and the time when an Entry of the Verdict was made, 
nothing was Recorded on the Parchment Roll. The reason for this was that between the Joinder of Issue and the 
Rendition 
of the Verdict, the Trial takes place, and 
what occurs during this Trial does not Appear upon the Face of the Common-Law Record. Thus, Offers and 
Rejection of Evidence, the Court’s Instruction of the Jury, or its Refusal to Instruct as requested by Counsel, or any 
Misconduct Connected with the Trial, such as Prejudicial Remarks on the Part of the Court, and the like—that is— 
any Error that occurs at the Trial—cannot be corrected by resort to the Common-Law Record because not Apparent 
Upon its Face. Such Errors were preserved only in the notes made by the Presiding Judge, or in his memory, and 
were review-able, after Verdict and before Final Judgment, by a Motion for New Trial made before the Court En 
Bane at Westminster, within four days after the Commencement of the Next Term following the Rendition of the 
Verdict. As each of the Judges of the Court had Motions of a similar character coming up for decision from the 
Trials over which they had presided, the natural inclination of each Judge was to support the Rulings of his brother 
Jurists, and thus Overrule the Motion for a New Trial. Furthermore, Errors that occurred at the Trial were not 
Reviewable after Judgment on Writ of Error, because Not Apparent on any one of the Four Parts of the Common- 
Law Record. To remedy this Defect, Parliament enacted Chapter 31 of the Statute of Westminster II in 1285,6 which 
provided for Review of such Errors through

the use of is-hat came to be known as a Bill of Exceptions.~ 


Thus, it appears that in four out of five Retrospective Motions, the Court is permitted to consider only Defects 
Apparent Upon the Face of Part of the Common-Law Record—the Process, the Pleadings, and the Verdict—and 
Errors Occurring at the Trial were regarded 
as extraneous and not to be considered in rendering Judgment upon the Motions. Matters extraneous to or outside of 
the Record could be tested after Verdict and before Judgment only by a Motion for a New Trial. A distinction is 
made between Matter of Record and Matter of Exception, Matter of Record referring to those Errors Apparent 
upon the 


Face of the Common-Law Record and hence Reviewable after Final Judgment upon a Writ of Error, and Matter of 
Exception referring to those Errors which Occurred at the Trial, and were Not Apparent on the Face of the Common- 
Law Record, hence Reviewable after Final Judgment only by incorporating such Errors into the Record by means of 
a Bill of Exceptions, as authorized by Chapter 31 of the Statute of Westminster II in 1285.~ - 


THE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL 


305. A Motion for a New Trial calls for a re-examination by the Court of the occurrences at the Trial to determine 
whether any errors had been made upon the Trial, or whether any irregularities had occurred in connection with the 
Trial. A Motion for a New Trial does not reach defects in the Pleadings.

ex-amination occurred by reason of the Removal of the Record to a Higher Court by Writ of Error. When the 
Review was by a Motion for New Trial, which occurred before Judgmcpt, the Entry of Judgment was necessarily

the Pleadings, but was and is a Remedy for-any Misconduct, Error or Slip occurring in the progress of the Trial itself 
which might endanger its fairness, and which indicates the probability of a different result. Its purposewas to have 
the Court set aside the Verdict and order a New Trial on the ground that some Error had occurred at the Trial, con- 
sisting of some alleged Misconduct of the Parties, the Counsel, the Jurors or the Judge.e Prior to 1655, the Law 
Courts, it was said,* held themselves incompetent to set aside Ver-dicts, hence the only Remedy available for a Party 
who had been prejudiced by an improper Verdict was either by the then impractical Proceeding to Attaint the Jury, or 
by an Appeal to a Court of Equity, which, under some-conditions, might procure New Trials. The first case in which 
it was said a New Trial wase granted at Law, In order to meet the inadequacy of the Courts in refusing to set 
Verdicts-aside, was Wood v. Ounston,’° decided in 1655. But Lord Mansfield was of the opinion that New 
Trials were granted at Law at an earlier time?’

Sec. 305 


As heretofore indicated, at Common Law, 

after a Nisi Prius Trial, the Losing Party could Move for a New Trial before the Court, En Bane, at 

Westminster, the Judge who presided at the Trial being one of the members of this Court. As the procedure 

evolved in 

the American Courts, the Motion for a New 

Trial became one which was generally ad-dressed directly to the Judge who conducted 

the Trial, and sought to persuade him that he had committed some Error in one or more of 

his Various Rulings during the Trial, or that for some other reason Justice was not done. 
it is altogether proper that this Motion should be heard by the very Judge who tried the Case, as he is personally 
acquainted with the Facts involved, and able to judge as to their bearing upon the merits of the controversy, as well 
as give them their proper evaluation. And it was for this very reason that it became 
the established Rule that a Judge in passing 
upon a Motion for a New Trial exercised his own discretion, which, in general, was not reviewahle in an Anpeilate 
Court, as the Grant or Refusal of a New Trial could not be Assigned as Error in Another Court, 


While the discretion exercised by the Trial 
-Court in passing upon a Motion for a New Trial was not ordinarily subject to Appellate Review, it should be 
observed that some of the Errors urged in support of such a Motion may be and frequently are made the subject of 
Exceptions, and are thus incorporated into the Record by means of a Bill of Exceptions. In this way the same Errors 
which are urged below on Motion for a New Trial may be Reviewed by Writ of Error, which brings the Bill of 
Exceptions to the Appellate Court, or by Statutory Appeal. 


if the BiU of Exceptions reveals that the Trial Court committed Errors, as in improperly A&’nitting or Excluding 
Evidence, or in failing to correctly Instruct the Jury, the Appeilate Court may, on the ground of such Errors, Reverse 
the Judgment and grant a New Trial. Such a Course of Procedure involves 
no revision of the decision ol’ the Trial Court on the Motion for New Trial; that which is revised is the Erroneous 
Ruling which occurred at the Trial. And the New Trial which is granted, is granted not because the Trial Judge Erred 
in refusing it, but on the ground that he had previously Erred in his hearing of the case and with respect to a Matter 
which Impaired the Validity of the Judgment.’* 


Grounds for New Trial 


AT Common Law there was a wide discretion in the Judge as to the Causes for granting a New Trial, and the 
Statutory Grounds laid down in our Modem Codes and Practice Acts are not exclusive of all others.'* 


Page 593 of 735 


The Grounds for the Motion generally include such Errors and Irregularities in the Conduct of the Trial as Errors 
in Impaneling the Jury, Bribes and Private Communications of the Prevailing Party to the Jury, which may have 
influenced their Verdict, or Misbehavior of the Jury in their deliberations, as by intoxication, separation, private 
investigations, casting lots or drawing straws for the Verdict, or of the Jury bringing in a Verdict contrary to the 
weight of the evidence, so that the Judge is reasonably dissatisfied therewith, or if the Jury has given Excessive 
Damages indicating passion and prejudice, or if the Judge has erroneously Excluded or Admitted Evidence, or 
Misdirected the Jury on the Law controlling the case, so that in consequence they may have found an Unjustifiable 
Verdict; for these and any other reasons, which may amount for Error at the Trial, it is the duty of the Court to award 
a Retrial if

a fair hearing had not been had iii the Original Trial. 4 


All such Grounds for a New Trial, it should be noted, fall Outside the Common Law Record, as there was no place on 
the Roll for the Entry of such Errors, being known to the Judge only by memory, or by representations made to him 
by the Parties and incorporated into Sworn Affidavits submitted to the Trial Court. 


And, of course, the Motion for a New Trial, should be clearly differentiated from the Motion for Veniyc Vacian Dc

Another Matter for which New Trials are sometimes granted is surprise, where a Party using all diligence and 
care is placed in a situation injurious to his interests without his own default.'° One may reguiarly Subpoena a Witness, 
and he may be actually in attendance, but absent himself at the time when needed, without the knowledge or consent of 
the Party or his Attorney. But to avail himself of this Ground for a New Trial, the surprise must be such that there 
~vas no opportunity to Move for a Continuance of the Cause. If he liad the opportunity and neglected it, he cannot 
take the chance of a Verdict in his favor, and afterward claim the benefit of a Rehearthgi

THE MOTION FOR VENIRE 
FACIAS DE NOVO” 


306. The Motion for Venire Facias Dc Nova was, unlike the Motion for New Trinl, designed to Vacate the Verdict and 
obtain a Retrial on the basis of Defects Appearing on the Record; and if granted when it should not be, it was Error, and the 
Award of it could be reversed, whereas a Motion for a New Trial was commonly granted after a General Verdict for some 
Cause not Apparent on the Record, and was not Assignnble for Error, 


THE Motion for Venire Facias Dc Novo was an Ancient Proceeding of the Common Law, in use long be~2ore the 
Motion for a New Trial. 


IS. In referring to tile distinction between a Motion 


for Ve,zire Fades Dc Nero and a Motion for a New 
Trial, in the ease of Witham v. Lewis, 1 Wils. KB. 
48, 55, 05 Eng.llep. 485, 489 (2744), Chief Justice 
Wilies declared: 


“Tue Counsel at the Bar endeavored to confound a Ve. Pa. Be Ncro and a Motion for aXe-v,- Trial. but they ace very different th rigs they a 
err-a i isdeeti in some things, but differ -in many: thevegr cc in this, that a Ve. Pa. Dc Noro must be awarded Ia both, and that the Court 
may or may not grant either of them; but they differ first in this, that 
* Fe. Fri. Be 2~ovo is tile ancient proceedi]sg of the Common Law, a New Trial is only a new invention; the first is as Ancient as the Law, 
wile’s attuints were in use, but Motions for New Triats were introduced in this manner; the Judgment in Attaint was very severe, and the 
punisl.nuent oxcessively hard, and therefore to avoid that severity it was thought bet icr to prrr-cerl in :1 milder way, and so Motions for New 
Trials were introduced, They likewise differ in this respect, that New Trials are generally granted where n General Verdict is found, a Fe. Fe, 
De Nero upon a Special Verdict. 


“But the most material difference between them is this, that a Fe. Fe. Be Nero must he granted upon Matter appearing upon the Record, but a New 
Trial may be granted uu)on things out of it; if the Record be ‘lever so right; if the Verdict appear to he contrary to the Evidence given at the 
Trial. or if it appear that the Judge has given wrong directions, a Icew Trial will be granted: but it is otherwise as to a ye, Fe-. Dc Noro, which 
can only be granted in one or other of these two eases, as 1st., ii it appear upon the Face of the Verdict, that the Verdict is so imperfect that no 
Judgment can be given upon it; 2db’., where it appoars that the Jury ought to have found other facts differently, and it cannot be granted in any 
other case.”

Cli. 27 

Its ObjeCt, of course, was to obtain a New Trial; and it was commonly employed after a Special Verdict 
imperfectly found, but always for some Cause Upon the Record.’9 It differed from the Motion for New 
Trial, which was based on Matters Extraneous to the Record. If granted when it should not be, it was 
Error, and the Award of it could be reversed, whereas a Motion for a New Trial was commonly granted 
after a General Verdict and was not assignable for Error. The Motion for Ventrc Fat-ia-s Dc Nova was 
granted where a Verdict was so imperfect that Judgment could not properly be grounded upon it.” This 
might occur where the Verdict was not responsive to the Issue, or where some irregularity in the 
Impaneling of the Jury was involved, provided such insufficiency or irregularity was Apparent on the Roll. 
If the Motion to Set Aside the Verdict and to 

Award a Venis’e Facias Do No-vo was granted, a Writ was then issued requiring the Sheriff to Summon a New 
Jury to try the Cause.” 


TIIE MOTION IN ARREST OF JUDGMENT 


Page 595 of 735 


307. The Court will generally, on Motion, refuse to Enter Judgment upon a Verdict, Default, or 
Demurrer to Evidence, when substantial Defects exist in the Pleadings or the Verdict. And the Defect must be 
at least one which would have been fatal on a General Demurrer, and not one which a Verdict would cure; and 
it must be Apparent on the Face of the Record. If a Declaration shows No Cause of Action whatever, or a 
Plea is utterly Wanting in Stating a Defense, the Entry of a Judgment clearly cannot be allowed to represent 
what has not been established. And, of course, a Motion in Arrest of Judgment must 

be made After Verdict and Before Rendition of the Judgment. It operates, with significant differences, as a 
kind of Delayed Demurrer.

Definition 


IN Legal Proceedings, a “Motion” is an application, either written or made viva voce, by a Party to an Action or a 
Suit for some kind of Relief.” And a Motion in Arrest of Judgment is a procedural device, entered upon the Record, 
and is designed to Stay 23 Judgment, or prevent its Entry, pending a determination of whether the Record will sup- 
port the Judgment. Such a Motion usually occurs after an Issue of Fact has been tried and a Verdict Found, but the 
Motion is also available after a Default, in which case it is treated exactly as if it had been a Demurrer to the 
Declaration, and not like a Motion made after Verdict,” 


The Principle Underlying the Motion 

TUE Theory of the Motion in Arrest of Judgment is that the Judgment of the Court is a Conclusion of Law from 
all the Facts ascertained and spread upon the Record, and as such Conclusion must rest upon and be collected from 
the Whole Record, the Party who does not, upon the Entire Record, appear entitled to Judgment, cannot have it, 
Thus, a Substantive Defect is available at the Pleading Stage, by Demurrer; After Verdict and Before Judgment, by 
Motion in Arrest of Judgment; and After Judgment, by Writ of Error. And this principle holds true even though a 
Verdict has been found, a Default suffered, or a Demurrer to Evidence determined in favor of the Party, who, upon 
the Whole Record, appears not to be entitled to Judgment. For even in the face of such Verdict, Default or Final 
Ruling on a Demurrer to Evidence, the Record, as viewed as a whole, may disclose No Right of Action, or no Legal

Defense, in his favor,” as the Case may be. And, therefore, if a Verdict is found for the plaintiff, upon a Declaration 
substantively defective—as in Ejectment in which there is a failure to allege title—or for the defendant, on a Plea in 
Bar totally void, Judgment must in either case be Arrested. The Motion in Arrest of Judgment, of course, must be made 
Before Judgment and it operates, with significant differences, as a kind of Belated Demurrer,”° 


The Question on a Motion in Arrest of Judgment is One of Lay, 

THE Motion in Arrest of Judgment raises a Question of Law; it in effect asserts that there is some Error Apparent 
on the Face of the Record which in Point of Law vitiated the proceedings culminating in the Verdict; that is, 
Judgments were Arrested only for intrinsic causes.” And after the Statutes of Amendments and Jeofails, the Error 
Manifest upon the Face of the Record was required to 


be One of Substance and Not One in Form. 


Defects Available Upon Motion in Arrest of Judgment - 


UNDER the Ancient Common Law a Motion in Arrest of Judgment could reach mere Defects in Form in the 


Pleadings. After the Enactment of the English Statutes of Amendments and Jeofails, this Practice of using the Motion in 
Arrest to reach Formal Faults in

the Pleadings, was corrected.” In consequence of these Statutes, Judgments are now largely protected against Arrest for 
Defects in Form, as well as for Various other Defects, which had once been treated as Substantive, but which, by the 
combined impact of the Statute of Elizabeth in 1585 ~ and the Statute of Anne in 1705,~° have been specifical)y 
enumerated and expressly cured.*! 


At Common Law, and aside from any Statutory Provisions, there are Many Defects in Pleading which formerly have 
been treated as Substantive, and which would be regarded as fatal, except for their being Aided by Verdict. If a 


Page 597 of 735 


Defect is Cured by Verdict, a Motion in-Arrest of Judgment will not be sustained. 


With respect to such imperfections as are Aided by Verdict at Common Law, it was early observed, “that where 


there is Any Defect, Imperfection, or Omission in Any Pleading, whether in SubstanCe or Form, which would have 
been a Fatal Objection upon Demurrer; yet if the Issue Joined be such as necessarily required on the Trial Proof of 
the Facts so Defectively or Imperfectly Stated or Omitted, and without which it is not to be presumed that either 
the Judge would Direct the Jury to give, or the Jury would have given the Verdict, such Defect, Imperfection, or 
Omission, is Cured by the Verdict by the Common Law.” ~ And this Rule has subsequently been 
followed,

Sec. 307 


Since after the Statute of Demurrers,”” in 1585, Supplemented and Amended by the Statute of Anne in 
1705,~~ Formal Defects in the Record were Waived except on Special Demurrer, it followed that thereafter 
Judgment could not be Arrested for any other than a Substantive Defect. Such a fault may be found either in the 
Pleadings or in the Verdict if one has been rendered. Thus, where the plaintiff has been Awarded a Verdiet 
on a Declaration Totally Defective in Substance—as where in Trover he fails to allege a Conversion—or 
varies totally from the Original Writ—as where the Writ sued out 
was in Special Assumpsit for Breach of a Contract and the Verdict was in Case for a Tort— Judgment may 


pe Arrested on the defendant’ s Motion. But if the Declaration was Substanlively Vaiid, and the Plea in Bar on which 


the 


defendant obtained a Verdict is Substantively Defective—as where the defendant Pleaded 


Not Guilty to a Declaration in Assumpsit— the Judgment may in turn be Arrested on the 
Motion of the Plaintiff.” In each instance the 
Defect at which the Motion Struck was in the 
Pleading. 
The Defect may, however, be in the Verdict. Thus, where the Pleadings terminate in 


a Perfect Issue, but the Jury finds a Verdict Materially at Variance with the Issue—as 
where the Issue is whether the defendant owns Blackacre and the Jury by its Verdict finds that the defendant owns 


Greenacre— Judgment will be Arrested for the insufficiency of the Verdict The Court cannot tell from such a 
Verdict for which Party the Judgment should be given. And, in general, it is a universal Rule in Arresting 
Judgment, that any Defect in the Record which would render erroneous a Judgment entered in pursuance of 
a Verdict, constitutes a valid ground for Arresting the Judgment. “For,”

says Gould, “no Court should do so nugatory an act, as to render a Judgment, which~ when Rendered, must be 


erroneous.” ~- 


Defects in the Pleadings 

IT has been an invariable Rule that No Defect in the Pleadings which would not have been fatal to them on a General 
Demurrer can be available for Arresting a Judgment,” Formal Defects being Cured by Statute or open only to Special 
Demurrer. The Converse of the Rule, however—that all Substantial Defects will support this Motion—is not 
universally true, as they may consist of the omission of particular Facts or circumstances which, in accordance with a 
Rule we have heretofore considered, the Court will presume, after a Verdict, to have been duly proved.” This 
distinction furnishes the true criterion as to what Defects in a Declaration or Plea are Grounds for Arresting 
Judgment. If they come within the Rule of Aider by Verdict, the Motion cannot be sustained.“

LITIGATING THE CONTROVERSY 


tiff is entitled to the Judgment of the Court, although a Verdict has been found against him. In the other case, that he 
is not entitled to the Judgment of the Court, although a Verdict has been delivered in his favor. 
Like the Motion for Judgment Non Obstante Vercd-icio, that in Arrest of Judgment must always be grounded 
upon something Apparent on the Face of the Pleadings; for instance, if, in an Action against the indorser of a Bill of 
Exchange, the plaintiff were to omit to allege in his Declaration that the defendant had notice of dishonor, Judgment 
would be Arrested even after a Verdict in the plaintiff’ s favor. 

“The power to make these respective Motions, coupled with the inability to Demur and Plead at the Same Time, 
led to a practice of passing over Objections to the Pleadings until After the Trial, when it was too late to Amend, and 
the successful litigant was often deprived of the fruits of a Verdict according to the merits by a slip in the Pleadings, 
which might have been remedied if brought to his notice by Demurrer.” ~ 


An utter failure to keep in view the proper Functions of Pleading is strikingly shown when a Fair Trial on the 
merits of a case is set at naught by a Motion in Arrest of Judgment, by Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or 
even on Writ of Error, because of a lack of some Allegation in the Declaration. And some have regarded such an 
outcome a perversion of Justice by the Rules of Procedure, resulting from the blind and mechanical application of 
Rules for their own sake. Of course, all too often, astute practitioners, instead of giving gratuitous instructions to 
their opponents, permit them to go through the Trial on Defective Pleadings, and then wipe out all the results of the 
Trial if it goes against them, by Motion in Arrest of Judgment, or a Similar Motion. 


41. J. W. Smith, Action at Law, 183 (11th ed, London 

1813). See, also, Kelly v. Chicago City R. Co., 283 

111. 640, 119 N.E. 622 (10183. 

In referring to this type of practice, in the Illinois case of Oilman V. Chicago Railway Co.,42 Craig, J., in 
dissenting, declared: “The defendant, if not sufficiently informed of the Statement of Claim, had the right to demand 
a more Specific Statement, but instead of that it filed an Affidavit of Merits, in which it reserved the right to object to 
any insufficiency of plaintiff's claim, went to Trial, and had a Fair Trial on the Merits, and, having been 
unsuccessful in the Trial, now asks that the Judgment be Reversed because the Statement of Claim did not set out a 
Complete Cause of Action.” ~ The majority of the Court failed to appreciate that the main Function of Pleading is to 
clear the ground preparatory to the Trial. The need of a formal “basis for the Judgment” is not a sufficient reason for 
permitting such Objections to Pleadings to be raised and be availed of after a Trial on the Merits, unless it is shown 
that the defendant was actually prevented from having a Fair Trial by reason of the Defect. 


In some States, a defendant, when a Demurrer has been erroneously overruled, may not Move in Arrest of 
Judgment; yet he may Move for Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto, or he may secure a Reversal of the Judgment 
on Writ of Errorfr~ But it has been well said that “a Court, by Ruling Wrongly on a Demurrer, does not preclude 
itself from afterwards Ruling Rightly upon a Motion in Arrest of Judgment.” ~

Defects in the Verdict 

FROM the logical nature of the Rules governing all Common-Law Pleading, it is apparent that, if a Verdict is to 
be effective as a finding upon the Issues presented, it must conform to and include all matters of Substance covered 
by such Issues. Judgment will consequently be Arrested when a General Verdict, awarding Entire Damages, is given 
on a Declaration containing Several Counts, some of which are bad, but not when it is silent as to matters which, 
though submitted, can have no effect upon the merits of the controversy.“ 


Relation of Motion in Arrest of Judgment and 

Aider by Verdict 

AS we have seen,” it is well settled that Faults in Pleading may in some cases be Aided or Cured by Verdict. 
Thus, where the plaintiff, in alleging a grant which must have been by deed, fails to expressly State in the 
Declaration that it was by deed, and the defendant, instead of Demurring, as he would be entitled to do, and in case 
of which the Declaration would be held bad, Pleads Over, and Issue is taken upon the grant, and a Verdict rendered 
for the plaintiff, the Verdict Cures the Defect in the Declaration, and no objection can be taken on that ground by 
motion in Arrest of Judgment, or by Writ of Error.’ ~ The doctrine of Aider by Verdict is

824 (1837); Posnett iz. Marble, 62 Vt. 481, 20 A. 813 (1890). 


In most States if there is One Good Count by which a General Verdict can be supported, Judgment will not be arrested because some of the 
counts are detective. Langan i: Enos Fire Escape Co., 233 Ill.

founded on the Common Law, and is entirely independent of any Statutory Enactment. The expressions “Cured” or 
“Aided by Verdict” signify that the Court will, after Verdict, presume or intend that the particular thing which 
appears to be Defectively or Imperfectly Stated, or Omitted, was duly proved at the Trial so as to support the Ver- 
dict. But, if the Declaration fails to allege any Substantive Fact which is essential to the Statement of a Cause of 
Action, and which is not implied in, or inferrable from the finding on those which are alleged, a Verdict for the 
plaintiff does not Cure the Defect. Thus, for example, if in Ejectment the plaintiff Omits the Allegation of Ouster, 
and the Jury nevertheless finds a Verdict for the plaintiff, the Judgment must be Arrested.

Lord Ellenborough, J., declared: “Where a matter is so essentially necessary to be proved that, had it not been given 
in evidence, the Jury could not have given such a Verdict, there the want of Stating that Matter in Express Terms in 
the Declaration, provided it contains Terms Sufficiently General to comprehend it in Fair and Reasonable In- 
tendnient, will be Cured by a Verdict; and where a General Allegation must, in fair construction, so far require to be 
restricted that No Judge and No Jury could have properly treated it in an unrestrained sense, it may be reasonably 
presumed, after Verdict, that it was so restrained at the Trial.” And, the principle was well stated, as previously ob- 
served, that “where there is any Defect, Imperfection, or Omission in Any Pleading, whether in Substance or Form, 
which would have been a Fatal Objection upon Demurrer; yet if the Issue Joined be such as necessarily required on 
the Trial Proof of the Facts so Defectively or Imperfectly Stated or Omitted, and without which it is not to be 
presumed that either the Judge would Direct the Jury to give, or the Jury would have given the Verdict, such Defect, 
Imperfection, or Omission, is Cured by the Verdict by the Common Law.” so 


It is only where a “Fair and Reasonable Intendment” can be implied that a Verdict will cure the objection. The 
Intendment must arise not from the Verdict alone, but from the combined effect of the Verdict, and the Issue upon 
which the Verdict was given, as shown by the Record. It is essential that ‘the particular thing that is to be presumed 
to have been proven shall be such as can reasonably be implied from the Allegations on the Record. The criterion by 
which to distinguish between Defects in a Declaration

which are, and such as are not, Cured by Verdict, was laid down in the year 1781, by Lord Mansfield, in the case of 
Rushton v. Aspinall,” to the following effect: Where the statement of the plaintiff's Cause of Action, or Title, is 


Defective or inaccurate, the Defect is Cured by a General Verdict in his favor; because, to entitle him to re- 
cover, all circumstances necessary, in Form or Substance, to complete the Title so Imperfectly Stated, must be 
proved at the Trial, and it is therefore a fair presumption that they were so proved. But, where no Title or Cause of 
Action is shown, the Omission is Not Cured; for if a necessary Allegation is altogether Omitted from the Pleading, 
or if the latter contains Matter Adverse to the Right

of the Party Pleading it, and so clearly expressed that no reasonable construction can alter its meaning, a Verdict will 
afford no help. A more simple statement of the Rule is that a Verdict will Cure the Defective Statement of a Title, 
but Not the Statement of a Defective Title. 


The Verdict must be for the Party in whose favor the implication is to be made, for it is in consequence of the 
Verdict, and to Support it, that the Court is induced to put a Liberal Construction upon the Allegations on the 
Record.” 


THE MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT 


308. When a Plea is Good in Form, but shows no valid Answer to the Merits of the Action, the Court will order 
Judgment for the plaintiff, Notwithstanding a Verdict in favor of the defendant. The Motion will now be Granted in 
favor of a defendant, where the plaintiff's Pleadings are not sufficient to support a Judgment upon a Verdict in his 
favor. 


IN a certain class of cases, where the Party who has secured a Verdict, is not entitled to a Judgment upon it, the 
Court may not only Arrest the Judgment in pursuance of the Verdict, but may give Judgment in Chief, Non Obstante 


Page 603 of 735 


VerediCto; that is, in favor of the Party against whom the Verdict was found. But such a course of procedure was 
taken only in clear cases where there was no doubt that the Party, against whom the Issue was found, was entitled to 
Judgment upon the Whole Record.” This was, in effect, a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, and was granted, 
for example, where a Plea in Bar confessed a good Declaration, but the matter Alleged in Avoidance constituted no 
Legal Defense. In such

a situation, aS the right of the plaintiff to recover had been confessed by the Defective Plea, it would amount to 
a denial of Justice to withhold from the plaintiff a Judgmentin-Chief. 


It should be observed that in such a case the Judgment is in reality grounded upon the Confession made in the 
Plea, without regard to the Verdict, as the Verdict decides nothing however it may go,M 


Formerly, the Motion for Judgment Non Qbstctnte Veredicto, was granted only where it Appeared upon the 
Record that the plaintiff was entitled to Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict for the defendant; and the defendant 
wa,s limited to a Motion in Arrest of Judgment, and could not obtain a Judgment after a Verdict for the plaintiff 
upon a Bad Declaration.” But, under Modern Law, the Motion was also held available by some American Courts in 
favor of a defendant, where the plaintiff s Pleadings were not sufficient to support a Judgment in his favor.M 


It has been urged that this difference is unsubstantial, since a Judgment for the defendant without regard to the 
Verdict is in fact an Arrest of Judgment.” But according to 1Ceigwin,~* the difference is not altogether unsubstantial, 
as an Arrest of Judgment is by no means equivalent to the Entry of Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto. He ob

serves that upon an Arrest of Judgment, no Entry of Judgment is made for Either Party, except where the plaintiff 
desires a Judgment to be Entered for the defendant to serve as the basis of an Appeal, thus enabling him to have a 
Final Adjudication of the alleged Cause of Action. In the absence of such an Entry, the action stops at the Arrest of 
Judgment, with the rights of Neither Party prejudiced, and with the plaintiff free to renew the litigation in some other 
form and at some other time when success is more apt to attend his efforts. By contrast, a Judgment Non Qbstanto 
Veredjcto is as conclusive as is any other Judgment.°° 


And there is also a distinction between a Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto and a Re-pleader; the first being 
given when a Plea is Good in Form, but Bad in showing a Defense without merit upon which Issue is Joined and 
found for the Party Pleading; while the latter is Awarded when the Defect lies rather in the Manner of Statement 
than the Matter Pleaded, upon which aa’i Immaterial Issue is Joined. A Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto is always 
upon the Merits of the Action; a Repleader is upon the Form and Manner of Pleading.°? If a Plea is Defective, and 
the defendant succeeds at the Trial, the question is whether the Plea Confesses the Cause of Action. If it does, and 
the Matter Pleaded in Avoidance is insufficient, the plaintiff will be entitled to Judgment Notwithstanding the 
Verdict. If not, there should be a Repleader.

THE MOTION FOR REPLEADER 


Page 605 of 735 


309. When the Court, from the Whole Record, is unable to determine for whom the Judgment should be gi’~en, 
by reason of the Issue as developed by the Pleadings having been an Immaterial One, it may order the Parties to Plead 
De Novo. 


WHEN the Parties to an Action have Joined Issue and the Jury has rendered a Verdict upon a point which in its 
nature is not calculated to determine the controversy on its merits, the Court, not having the proper material upon 
which to render a Final Judgment in Bar for One Party or the Other, will direct the Parties to Replead the case from 
the point where there was a Departure from correct Allegation.” Such a direction is only ordered after Verdict, for 
the obvious reason that until then the question for whom the Judgment should be rendered cannot well arise. 
Beginning with the first Defective Allegation, without regard to the side on which it appears, the New Pleading 
continues until each Faulty Pleading is replaced with a correct one, and there is a Joinder on a Material Issue, Which 
will make it possible to determine the case on the merits. 


The usual case for Awarding a Repleader occurs when the defendant, Not Confessing the Plaintiff's Cause of 
Action, sets forth some Fact which is immaterial and hence not calculated to decide the controversy on the merits, 
whereupon the plaintiff inadvertently traverses the Immaterial Allegation, upon which a Verdict is rendered. The 
Fact found by the Verdict, not being adapted to determine the litigation, and the Court, not able to render a Judgment 
on the merits, should order a Repleader for the purpose of producing a Material Issue. Thus, for example, where A 
brought Assumpsit against 


61. For a discussion of Repleader, see McRelvey, Common-Law Pleading, e. VII, Motions Based on the 

Pleadings, III, Repleader, 179—182 (Now York 

1914). See, also, Ex ~arte Pearce, 80 Ala. 195 

(1885). 

an Administrator, and alleged a Promise by the decedent to pay money, and B, the defendant, Denied that he so 
Promised, the Flea neither Admits nor Denies the Promise of the decedent. The fact that B set up, to wit, that he had 
made No Promise, whether true or untrue, was irrelevant, and not responsive to A’s Allegation that the decedent had 
promised to pay the money. To this Plea, the plaintiff should Demur, but if he should mistakenly Traverse it, the Is- 
sue created would be an immaterial one, and a Verdict would not, therefore, be decisive as to the merits of the case. 
Accordingly, the Court should Award a Repleader to establish an Issue of Fact upon which a Judgment on the merits 
might be rendered for one Party or the other.” 


The famous case of Staple v. Heydon 63 affords another example of a situation which called for a Repleader. A 
brought Trespass against B, alleging that .8 had wrongfully entered upon a certain wharf in the Thames river. This 
wharf was held by A under a lease from C and adjoined a lot on the bank which was held by B under a lease from the 
same C. B Pleaded that he had a right of way over the wharf, derived from C; but the Plea was Defective in Form 
because in tracing title it showed that C himself was a lessee, and it did not show from what seisin in fee his term 
was derived. For this reason his Plea was held Demurrable in Form although it was Valid in Substance. In order to 
bolster his Defence, B in his Plea further alleged that he had no other way of egress from his lot to the river than by 
crossing the wharf, which Plea of a right of way by necessity was not supported by the Facts stated in relation to his 
title. To this part of the Plea A Replied that B had “another convenienter way to the river.” The Issue thus taken upon 
the Replication of A was

63. 2 tAt. Raym. 921, 92 Eng.Uep. 115 (1703). 
579 


clearly Immaterial, and upon a Verdict for the defendant at the Trial, the Court held that the case was one in which a 
Repleader was proper. So, where, as in the instant case, a defendant interposes a Defense which in itself is valid, but 
then adds an Allegation of an Immaterial Fact, and the plaintiff mistakenly takes Issue upon that Fact, after which a 
Verdict is rendered, no Material Issue arises upon which the Court can determine the case upon its merits, and the 
Verdict, whether for One Party or the Other, fails to guide the Court as to who is entitled to Judgment. 


In the example above, the Plea does not Confess the plaintiff's Cause of Action by admitting his title, but Denies 
his right, although placing the Defense upon an untenable ground. As the defendant has not admitted a prima facie 


Page 606 of 735 


right in the plaintiff, which he has not sufficiently avoided, but on the contrary has disputed the plaintiff’ s right, but 
for reasons which are invalid, the plaintiff is not in a position to demand a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict. 
The Verdict upon the Issue as to whether the defendant had a convenient egress from his lot to the river other than 
by crossing the wharf, was not determinative of the Issue as to whether the defendant had trespassed upon the 
plaintiff's wharf. It follows, therefore, that the distinction between a case for Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto and 
one for Repleader turns on whether or not the defendant has by his Plea Confessed the plaintiff s Cause of Action.” 
As Iceigwin observes: “If the Plea admits the Tort or the Breach of Contract alleged and undertalces to Justify or 
Discharge it by matter not sufficient for that purpose, a Verdict for the defendant merely proves the insufficient 


Avoidance and leaves the Admission still effective. But, if the Plea contains No Con-fession and only some 
Immaterial Matter

310. In general, it may be said that the Retrospective Motions, as they existed at Common Law, were adopted in 
the Early Period of American Procedural Development. Subsequently, due to the lack of a Centralized Court System, 
under which the Trial Judges sat En Eanc, as in England, certain Modifications in the Procedures Regulating these 
Motions were made. But in substance these Procedures followed and still follow the Pattern developed by the 
Common Law Practice. 
Motions for New Trials 

WITH certain Modifications it may be said that the English Common-Law Practice as to Granting New Trials 
was adopted by the American Courts, being used to Review Errors that occurred at the Trial and which were not 
Apparent on the Face of the Common-Law Record. And the Grounds for Granting New Trials, as developed in Eng- 
land, have become the recognized Grounds for New Trials in both Common-Law and Code Jurisdictions.” The Four

Day Period after the Entry of the Verdict, during which, at Common Law, the Motion is normally made, has ranged 
from Two Days in the State of Washington 67 to Sixty Days in Wisconsin.M Rule 59(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil 


Procedure provides that the Motion may be made as late aS Ten Days after Judg 
ment.

According to Millar,” our Courts have followed the Common-Law Practice in allowing more time where the 
Motion for New Trial is based upon Newly Discovered Evidence. A Motion on this Ground may be made within a 
reasonable time, Not More than One Year from the Date of Judgment, under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Ituics of Civil 
Procedure, 

The Motion for New Trial, as at Common Law, is still addressed to the Court’s discretion.’ While there is a 
distinction bets%’een a Motion Raising a Question of Law, and one incorrectly characterized as an “Error in Fact,” 
as, for example, where it is asserted that the Verdict is against the weight of evidence, it seems clear that in most 
Jurisdictions Errors of Law not productive of manifest injustice will not warrant the granting of a New Trial. 
Unfortunately, some American Courts have followed the 1835 English Court of Exchequer Rule, under which, in the 
matter of evidence, “an Error of Ruling created per se for the excepting and defeated party a right to a New Trial.” 
~The Common-Law Rule, under which a New Trial was not in order, even though mistakes may have occurred, if it 
appeared upon the whole that substantial Justice had been done, now seems the proper solution. Within forty years 
after it was adopted, the “Exchequer Rule” was abolished in England under the Judicature Acts, with the Rules of 
1875, which provided that a New Trial on the ground of an improper Instruction by the Court or an improper 
Admission or Rejection of Evidence, was not to be granted unless “some substantial wrong or mis-

carriage has been thereby occasioned in the Trial of the Action.” 72 


The Motion for a New Trial in America is generally no longer passed upon by the Court En Banc, but by the 
Trial Judge. This change in the Common-Law Practice resulted from a decentralization of the Trial Courts, and the 
development of Review of Erroi’s by separate Appellate Courts. 


At Common Law a Verdict was indivisible, hence a New Trial involved a Retrial of All Issues, and this was true 
although the Motivating Error was not applicable to All Issues, and the Same Parties were also involved in the New 
Trial. One of the earliest recognitions of the Doctrine of Severability of Issues and Parties came in Massachusetts in 
1831 in the case of Winat v. Columbian Insurance Co.,” and since then has come to prevail in Other States. 


Related to this problem is that of whether a Court may condition its refusal of a New Trial on the plaintiff s 
remission of an appropriate amount for that of the Verdict. In Wood v. Gunstone ~ decided in 1655, a New Trial was 
granted because the Damages were Excessive, and this practice has continued.’ Nor does the Court’s Action in this 
respect violate the Constitutional Right to Trial by Jury)° A more difficult question arose when the Amount of 
Damages given in the Verdict appeared Inadequate, and there has been some doubt expressed as to the Constitution- 
ality of Statutes in Some States prohibiting 


72. For the details of this development, see Millar, Civil Procedure of the Trial Court In Historical Perspective, e. XIX, Trial by Jury, § 7, The

New Trials because of the Smallness of the Damages Awarded.” The narrow English doctrine as to the Severability 
of Issues received a check in the decision of Chief Justice Doe of New Hampshire in the case of Lisbon v. Lyman,” 
in which he took the position that a Party had a right to have a Prejudicial Error in a Tria] corrected, but not a right to 
a New Trial if the error could be otherwise corrected, and that in making such correction it was necessary to destroy 
only what was erroneous when the latter could be severed from the former. This Ruling was followed in Other 
States, New Jersey making it the subject of a Provision of the New Jersey Practice Act of 1912.~° And in Dimick v. 
Schiedt,*° the problem dealt with the Issue in a negative manner, the Supreme Court holding that, regardless of 
Earlier Rulings, the Common Law at the time of the adoption of the Constitution “forbade the Courts to increase the 
Amount of Damages awarded by a Jury in Actions such as that here under consideration,”—(hat the practice of 
Increasing Damages, where the Damages given by the Verdict were Inadequate, was no part of recognized 
practice—and hence was to be regarded as in violation of the Seventh Amendment. Mr. Justice Stone, in a dis- 
senting opinion, viewed this conclusion as untenable, and it has been urged that there appears to be no convincing 
reason why the Additur should not be governed by the same considerations as the Remittitur.*

The Motion in Arrest of Judgment 

THE Motion in Arrest of Judgment was used in the Early Period of American Procedure, and is still in effect in 
our Common Law Jurisdictions. In Some States, as, for example, Massachusetts s7 and Rhode Island,*° its use was

in Civil Cases. No mention of the Motion was included in the New York Code of Procedure in 1848, but it has 
received Statutory Recognition in a Few States having Unitary Procedures, such as Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, North

Carolina and Texas, In a Few Other States such as Colorado and South Carolina, it has been used without such Stat- 
utory Recognition. In still Other States, as in Kentucky, the Motion in Arrest and the Motion for Judgment Non 
Obstante were fused by Statutory Enactment,® and this practice has been adopted in a number of Other States. This 
latter Motion, which is in effect a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, is not restricted to a Motion After Verdict, 
and it had the combined effect of a Demurrer and the relevant Common-Law Motions. In New York the recognition 
of the Judicial Equivalent of the Common-Law Mo-dons was given Statutory Effect in 1908 when the Legislature 
provided that where either Party was entitled to Judgment on the Pleadings, the Court might give Judgment at any 
time after Issue Joined,*° and this provision was carried forward in the Civil Practice Act

at any Stage of an Action or Appeal. In the Common-Law Motions, the result of the Motion turns upon the 
Pleadings exclusively, without any regard to the evidence. The Rule is probably to the contrary under the liberal 
provisions as to Amendment which now prevail, except where the Fact involved was neither alleged nor subject to 
Proof, This situation was met in England by the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852,~~ which permitted the Party 
whose Pleadftlg was said to be Defective to suggest the existence of the Fact in question, which, when Pleaded to by 
the Opposite Party, was then tried. If found in favor of the Suggesting Party, he was entitled to the rendition of the 
same Judgment which would have been entered if the fact had been Originally Stated in the Pleading under attack. 
This Practice was adopted in substance in Florida.” 


Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the Motion in Arrest of Judgment is not recognized, but the same 
work to some extent is done by the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, which may be made in advance of the 
Trial.” And under the Amendments of 1946, and the rule currently in effect, it is provided that if Matters Outside the 
Pleadings are considered on the Motion, such Motion is to be treated as One for Summary Judgment.°’

Judgment, was affected by the Statute of Demurrers 92 and the doctrine of Aider by Ver- 
dict. It was used during the Developmental Stage of American Procedure, and, like the 
Motion in Arrest, has been retained in the Common Law States. It received no recognition 
in the New York Code of Procedure in 1848. Under Modern English Law the names of 
the Retrospective Motions no longer constitute a part of “the working procedural vocab-

Defense after Verdict, is converted into one as to whether a Proper Cause of Action or

THE DEFINITION AND NATURE OF 
A JUDGMENT 


311. A Judgment is the Award of Relief pronounced by a Court, upon the Facts Found. 


AT Common Law, on the expiration of the Rule for Judgment, if there were no previous Motion for a New Trial, or 
in Arrest of Judgment, and if the prevailing Party had had the Postea stamped and marked by the Clerk of the Postea, 
he might proceed to sign Final Judgment. 


According to Blackstone, in Ancient Times a Judgment was represented as the determination and Sentence of the 
Law and not the determination or sentence of the Judge pronouncing it,’ The theory was that it would better 
command the obedience of the suitors and the support of the community if it was regarded as the Act of the Law, 
binding on all, as opposed to being treated as the Act of the Judges, who were not infallible. This distinction found 
expression in the Style and Form of the Judgment, which were said to be 


2-3 Blackstone, Commentaries oi the Laws of Englaud, 396 (6th ed., Dublin, 1775). 

“the Sentence of the Law, pronounced by the Court upon the Matter Contained in the Record.” 2 Thus, the Ancient 
Judgment made no mention of the Judges,’ but read: “It is considered by the Court” (consideToturn est per curiani) 
that the plaintiff do recover his Damages, his Debt, his Possession, and the like; which implies that the Judgment is 
none of their own, but the Act of Law, pronounced and declared by the Court.” 


THE JUDGMENT THE OBJECT OF AN ACTION 
312. An Action or Suit is a Proceeding, the object of which is to secure a Judgment. 


UNDER the Modem View, it may be said that the Final Judgment or Decree is the Award of the Relief provided 
by Law for the redress of injuries or the enforcement of

rights, as that the plaintiff do recover his Damages, his Debt, his Possession and the like, and the entire Action or 
Suit is merely the vehicle or means of pursuing and making application for this Award. An Action or Suit may be 
defined as a Proceeding to obtain a Judgment (which term we may use to include the Decrees of Courts of Equity), 
which is the great end and object of all contentious proceedings. The Final Judgment is the Conclusion of Law 
officially declared and pronounced by the Court upon the Facts Found, after due deliberation and inquiry, declaring 
that the plaintiff has either shown himself entitled, or has not, to recover the redress he sues for. In Jurisdictions 
which have abolished the distinctions between Law and Equity as far as Procedure is concerned, the final 
determinations of any Action or Suit is called a Judgment.° 


The natural right to relief for Breaches of Contracts would seem to be performance in Kind, to be enforced by an 
Order of the Court directing the defendant to perform under threat of punishment by imprisonment or fine. So, in the 
case of Tort, it would seem that the plaintiff should have a right to specific reparation, by a decree compelling the 
Tort-Feasor to restore the state of things that would have existed but for his wrong. Likewise, in the case of a claim 


Page 612 of 735 


to property, the natural relief would seem to be a decree requiring the detainer to deliver possession of the property 
and make restitution of the very thing itself. 


As a General Rule, however, Money Damages are the panacea of the Common Law; Specific Relief is regarded 
as exceptional and extraordinary, and generally attainable only in Equity, except in the case of recovery of Debts 
and of Possession of Real and Personal Property. 


5- See Walker y. Walker, 93 Iowa 643, 61 N.W. 930 
(1895). 
TEE JUDGMENT AT LAW AND DECREE IN EQUITY COMPARED AND 
DISTINGUISHED 


313. A Judgment at Law merely determines the Matter of Right between the Parties, whereas 4 Decree in 
Equity not only determines the Matter of Eight between the Parties, but orders the defendant to obey the Decree on 
Peril of Contempt for failure so to do. 


THE Judgment of a Common-Law Court did not order the wrongdoers to do anything; it did not directly seek to 
compel them to repair their wrongs. It merely determined the Matter of Right between the Parties. Thus, the 
Judgment was simply that the plaintiff do recover the Damages, Debt or Possession, as the case may be. If the moral 
persuasion of the Judgment was not sufficient to move the wrongdoer, then the Law intervened in aid of the 
Judgment. It sought by the exertion of physical force through the Sheriff and the seizure of the defendant’s property 
on Execution to give the plaintiff the Redress Awarded, The Sheriff was invested with legal authority, under Writs 


of Execution, tO seize, sell and transfer Title to the defendant’s property subject to debts, and by such seizure 
and sale to pay the Money Judgment out of the proceeds. But in no ease was it adjudged at Common Law that the 
defendant be compelled to act or aid the plaintiff or Sheriff to do Justice or Satisfy the Judgment. All that the 
defendant was required to do was to submit to the authorized acts of the Sheriff. The defendant could not be called 
before the Court and punished for a contempt because he did not actively exert himself in surrendering his property 
or disclosing its whereabouts to the Sheriff, so that he might carry out and Satisfy the Judgment. As Professor 
Langdell xrmarked: “The defendant may know where the property is, having purposely removed it or concealed it 


from the Sheriff; still he can-not be ordered to deliver it to the plaintiff.. SO, if a defendant has refused to Perform a 
Contract, a Court of Common Law can only give the plaintiff Damages, no matter how 
586

important to the latter actual performance may be.” o Neither did the Common-Law Courts successfully accomplish 
a division or partition of real estate among the several coowners, nor compel the rendering of an account, though this 
was formerly attempted. 


A Decree in Equity, as contrasted to a Judgment at Common Law, not only determined the Matter of Right 
between the parties; it ordered the defendant to do something about it, on peril of being jailed for Contempt if he 
failed so to do. This was done n the theory that in refusing obedience to the Decree, the defendant was guilty of a 
Contempt, not to the Chancellor, but to the King, and hence when he proceeded to punish him for Contempt, he used 
a Procedure unknown to the Common Law, the defendant being treated as if he were a rebel and contemner of the 
King’s Sovereignty-’ 


THE CLASSIFICATION AND SCOPE OF’ JUDGMENTS 


314. Judgments are either Interlocutory or Final. The former is one which defines the rights of the parties at an 


intermediate stage of the action, whereas the latter is one which ends the particular Action. The Scope of a 
Judgment is determined by its Form and object. 


interlocutory Judgments 


INTERLOCUTORY Judgments define the rights of the parties at an intermediate stage of the action, but they do not 


Page 613 of 735 


Terminate the Suit. Probably the best instances of Interlocutory Judgments are those entered by Default in Actions 
of Assumpsit, Case, Covenant and Trespass, where the Sole Object of the Action is the Recovery of Damages, by 
which at Common Law only the Right to recover is determined, leaving the Amount to be ascertained by a Writ of 
Inquiry or other proceedings 


6. A Summary of Equity Pleading, Introduction, IT, Origin and Nature of Equity Jurisdiction and Pro. eadure, 40, p. 32 (3d ecL, 
Cambridge, 1882). 


‘1. Id. at 1 38, p. 30. 
upon which a Final Judgment will be rendered. There is one species of Interlocutory Judgment, however, which 


establishes only the Inadequacy of the Defense interposed. A Judgment for the plaintiff on a Demurrer to @ Plea in 
Abatement is such a Judgment as it is a decision on a point independent of the Merits of the Case, and in Form is 
always that the defendant Answer Over. There are many Judgments, Interlocutory in character, which define the 
rights of the parties at an Intermediate Stage of the Action.” 


Judgments before Issue Joined are of various Kinds, including those referred to above, and are in their nature 
Interlocutory, though often not classed as such. They are generally the result of the fault or neglect of one of the 
Parties in failing to pursue the means available, and may be for either Party, If for the plaintiff, Judgment may be for 


Default of Appearance of the defendant, after being served with Process; or, in All Actions,! of Nit Dicit, where, 
having Appeared, he neither Demurs nor Pleads, nor maintains his Pleadings until the Issue is complete. Again, if 
the defendant’s Attorney Enters on Record a statement that he is not informed of any answer to be given, or if the 
defendant, having no Defense, chooses to Confess the Action, Judgment for the plaintiff will be respectively Non 
Sum Infarnwtus, or by Confession. If for the defendant, Judgments of Non Prose quitur, Retraxit, (Jassetur 
Breve, Nofle Prose qui, may be Entered against the plaintiff, according as he fails to maintain his Suit, or Prays that 
his own Writ be Quashed, or Discontinues the Action.” 


Thus, Interlocutory Judgments at Common Law may be Judgments which are followed by Final Judgments, such as a 
Default 


8. See Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. XIV, Trial, Verdict. Judgment and Execution, Art. ITT, Judgment, 310—310

°. Id. a371. 
Sec. 315 
THE JUDGMENT 
587 

Judgment which is followed by an Inquiry to assess Damages and then a Final Judgment; or, Interlocutory 
Judgments at Common Law may be such as settle an Issue in the course of the Action, but only to clear the way for 
another Issue to be raised in the same case, such as where the Judgment on an Jssue of Law on a Dilatory Plea is in 
favor of the plaintiff, in which case the Judgment is, Let the Defendant Answer Over to the Action, called a 
Judgment Respondeat Ouster.’° 


Final Judgments 

FINAL Judgments are instanced by the Judgments rendered where an Issue of Fact has been tried by a Jury, who 
also Assess the Damages. Also, at Common Law, a Judgment f or plaintiff on a Demurrer to a Pleading-in-Chief, 
where the damages are liquidated, and a Judgment for defendant on a Demurrer to a Pleading-in-Chief, are Final 
Judgments. In these cases, there is nothing left to be done, and the Judgment, therefore, necessarily ends that 
Particular Action, as distinguished from an Interlocutory Judgment, which leaves something remaining to be done 
and does not Terminate the Action. Thus, a Judgment for plaintiff at Common Law on a Demurrer to a Pleading-in- 
Chief where the damages are unliquidated, may initially be classified as Interlocutory, but it is followed, after 
assessment of damages, by a Final Judgment.” Final Judgments may be in different forms. If, for example, there is a 
Judgment for defendant on a Dilatory Plea, either on an Issue of Fact or Law, the Judgment is generally that the Writ 
be quashed, or the Action Dismissed. Though such a Judgment is not conclusive on the Merits of the Case, it

nevertheless disposes of the particular Suit, and has been classified as a Final Judgment.”” 


Under Modern Practice and Statutes, a ruling on a Demurrer to a Pleading-in-Chief usually does not result in a 
Final Judgment, as where a Demurrer to a Pleading-in-Chief is sustained, the Party whose Pleading is found 
defective is generally permitted to Amend his Pleading; and where a Demurrer to a Pleath ing-in-Chief is overruled, 
the Party ~‘.‘ho interposed the Demurrer is generally permitted to Plead Over. 


REVIVAL OF JUDGMENTS 


315. If no execution was had upon a judgment in a real action for a year, it was necessary to obtain a Scire Facias 
in order to execute. The same procedure was made available, by Statute, in cases where a Judgment had been 
obtained in a personal action. 


A Scire Facias was also necessary where a new person was to receive the benefit of or to be charged by the 
execution. 


WHEN, in a real action, Judgment was obtained at Common Law for a particular parcel of land, it was required 
that any execution thereunder be entered on the Roll. If no such entry appeared on the Roll for a year, execution 
could thereafter be had only by resort to a Writ of Scire Facias, which issued to show cause why execution should 
not be awarded under the Judgment." 


The reason the plaintiff was required to resort to Scire Facias after the lapse of a year was because it was 
presumed, in view of his long delay in executing upon the Judgment, that the execution was released. The defendant 
would not be disturbed in his possession without having the opportunity to plead release in Court, or showing cause 
why the execution should not be had.

JUDGMENT, EXECUTION AND APPELLATE REVIEW 
Ch. 28 


However, with respect to personal actions, the Common Law rule was otherwise. Where a plaintiff had taken no 
process of execution for a year, he could not then resort to Sci?e Facias, but was required to commence an action 
upon the Judgment, and the defendant ‘was obliged to show how the debt, which was evidenced by the Judgment, 
had been discharged, 


This situation with respect to Judgments which had been obtained in personal actions ‘was changed by Statute in 
1285,’~ and the plaintiff in a personal action was given recourse to a Sciire Facias to revive his Judgment, thereby 
conforming the procedure available to him with that which prevailed ~vith respect to judgments in real actions. 
However, due to the wording of the Statute some question arose as to whether this was true in the case of a 
Judgment obtained in an action of Ejectment, which was considered a personal action, or whether the Statute had 
failed to give the right to one holding a Judgment in Ejectment. In practice, however, the remedy was granted in 
such cases, which in fact appeared proper under a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language. 


A Scire Facias was also necessary in cases where a new person was to receive the benefit of or to be charged by 
the execution, because of the rule that executions must correspond with the Judgments upon which is- 
sued.~

STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, 
PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES 
OF COURT 


316. The Codes often define the Judgment so as to include both the Common Law Judgment and the Decree in 
Equity. Nevertheless, a Judgment on a claim essentially legal in nature retains the attributes of the Common Law 


Judgment, white a Judgment on a claim essentially equitable in nature retains the attributes of a Decree IM Equity. 


Under the Codes a Judgment is generally defined as the final determination of the rights of the parties in an 
action or a proceeding.” And where the Codes have purported fo abolish the distinction between actions at law and 
suits in equity, the final determination of the controversy, be it at law or equity, is termed a Judgment.'° Thus, the 
decree in equity has, from the standpoint of nomenclature, been replaced by the Judgment. 


To consider this change as being of substantive import, however, would obviously be in error. At Common Law, 
as indicated in the above discussion, the Judgment at Law was limited to a determination of the matter of right 
between the parties, while the Decree in Equity not only determined the Matter of Right between the parties, but also 
ordered the defendant to do something about it, on peril of being jailed for contempt if he failed to do so.'° The fact 
that under the Codes the term Judgment now is generally used to embrace both situations does not change the fact 
that a Judgment on a claim essentially legal in nature will still have the attributes of the Common Law Judgment, 
while a Judgment on a claim essentially equitable in nature will retain the attributes of a Decree in Equity.

There were a variety of Writs of Execution at Common Law against person and property, all of which must be sued out 
within a year after Final Judgment. 


The Definition and Nature of Execution 

AFTER Final Judgment, which in theory is the end of an Action, the plaintiff may, at any time within a year, sue 
out a Writ of Execution against the body, lands, or goods of the defendant, provided there be no Writ of Error 
pending, or agreement to the contrary.” 


An Execution may be defined as a Judicial Writ grounded on the Judgment of the Court from which it issues,” 
and is supposed to be Issued by the Court at the request of the party entitled thereto, to give him Satisfaction on the 
Judgment standing in his favor.“ 


The mere Judicial Declaration of the right to redress, the award of relief, can produce no practical benefit or 
result, unless the defendant, under its moral persuasion, voluntarily submits to its determination of the Matter of Right 
between the parties, and satisfies the plaintiff's demand, If such voluntary action is not forthcoming, then the 
plaintiff must resort to some Form of Execution, the compulsory process for satisfying the plaintiff's demand and 
putting the relief awarded by Judgment into Legal Effect by the exercise of Executive Force. 


Execution, therefore, is in the nature of an Executive Remedy, supplementary to the Judicial Remedy, and may 
consist: 


(1) In placing the plaintiff in possession of his land or property by force, the actual restitution of the thing 
taken or detained;

4. Id. at 324, 825. 
(2) In taking from the defendant what belongs to him and turning it over to the plaintiff, or selling it at public 
auction, transferring Title against the owner’s will, and applying the proceeds to satisfy the Judgment for money; 


(3) In seizing the goods or land of the defendant, and holding them as security until the defendant complies 
with the Judgment; 


(4) In seizing the person of the debtor himself and imprisoning him until he pays the debt or performs the 
commands of the Court. 


At Common Law, the Execution following the Judgment, is either for the plaintiff or the defendant. If for the 
plaintiff, the Exccution upon a Judgment in Assumpsit, Case, Covenant, Replevin or Trespass, was for the damages 
and costs; in Debt, for the debt damages and costs recovered; in Detinue, the Execution is for the goods or their 
value, with damages and costs. If for the defendant, upon a Judgment in Replevin at Common Law, the Execution is 
for a return of the goods. And, in the other Actions, upon a Judgment of Non-pros, Non-suit or Verdict, it is for the 
costs only. 


An Execution must be sued out of the Court which issued the Judgment. And while supposedly awarded by the 
Judge or Judges in Court, in reality and in practice no such award is in general actuaily made. The party who secured 
the Judgment, and who has a Right to a Writ of Execution, usually sued it out of the proper office in the Form 
adopted under the Law to the Form of Action and Nature of the Judgment to be carried into effect. According to 
Martin,° Executions fall properly into two general classes, each class turning upon the nature of the

Judgment to be enforced. These two types of Execution will now be considered, with attention being directed first to 
executions where the judgment awards possession of property, and second, where the judgment is for the recovery 
of money only, as a debt or damages. 


Restitution of Possession 

IN the case of a Judgment awarding possession of land, a Writ of Possession to the Sheriff, commanding him to 
give actual possession to the plaintiff of the land so recovered, is an efficient means to put the sentence of the Law 
into Force. To accomplish the delivery, the Sheriff may take with him the Posse Coni~tatus, or power of the county, 
calling to his assistance private citizens, and may justify breaking open doors, if the possession be not quietly 
delivered. But in the Action of Detinue for recovery of personal chattels, if the wrongdoer were very perverse, he 
could not be compelled to make restitution of the identical thing taken or retained; but he had his election to deliver 
the goods or their value, an imperfection in the Law, which resulted from the Nature of the Judgment and the 
methods of Execution employed.’ 


Execution Against Goods ci Profits of Land THE only Judgments given by the Common-Law Courts were those for the 
delivery of possession, or for the recovery of a debt or damages. By the Common Law a man could procure 
satisfaction for his money judgment from the goods and chattels of his debtor, or the present profits of his debtor’s land, 
by the Writs of then Facias and Levani Facias. The Writ of F’ieri Faciag

iff of the County where the Action is laid, commanding him that of the goods and chattels of the defendant, in his 
bailiwick, he cause to be made or levied, the sum of damages, or the debt recovered, and have it before the King at 
Westminster on the return day.” 


This Writ was issuable against privileged persons, peers and the like, as against other common persons; and 
against executors and administrators, in which latter case, the Sheriff was commanded to make the damages or debt 
out of the goods of the deceased.” By this Writ, the Sheriff has authority to seize and sell all tangible goods and 
chattels of the defendant, to satisfy the Judgment.” 


The Writ of Levani Facias 

AT Common Law, because of the high esteem in which real property was held, such property was not actually 
subject to Execution for the payment of the plaintiff's debts. Therefore, when the Writ of Levani F’acias issued, 
commanding the Sheriff to levy the plaintiff’ s debt on the lands and goods of the defendant, the Sheriff in executing 
the Writ, levied only on the goods of the debtor, and the rents and profits of the land, but not on the land itself.” The 
Sheriff was authorized to continue collection of the rents and profits of the land until the satisfaction of the Judgment 
had been secured. 


According to Martin, the Writ of Lerari Facias, was substantially superseded by the Writ of Elegit, which will be 
considered next -12

JUDGMENT, EXECUTION AND APPELLATE REVIEW 
Ch. 29 
The Writ of Elegit 
The Writ of Elegit was authorized by the Statute of Westminster II (1285), Chapter 
18. By reason of this Writ, the Sheriff seized the goods and chattels of the defendant, empannelled a Jury, who 
appraised the goods and chattels so seized, and, except for oxen and beasts of the plough, thereafter delivered them 
to the plaintiff at the price placed upon them in part satisfaction of the debt. If the goods and chattels proved 
insufficient to satisfy the Judgment, then one-half of his freehold lands were also delivered to the plaintiff, to be held 
until he had satisfied his Judgment or the debt out of the rents and profits thereof, or until the interest of the de- 
fendant in the land had expired. While holding the land for this purpose, the plaintiff was called a Tenant by Elegit. id 


This Execution, or seizing of land under an Elecjit, is of such high nature that after its issuance the body of the 
defendant could not be taken upon an? Other Writ; but where the Eregit could not be executed by delivery of lands for 
the reason that the defendant owned none, and where it appeared that any chattels and goods levied upon were not 
sufficient to satisfy the plaintiffs Judgment, the plaintiff might then sue out a Writ of Capias Ad Satisfaciendum."* 


Tue Writ of Extendi Facias, OY Extent 
THE Writ of Extendi F’acias, or Extent, at Common Law, lay, first, for the debts owed to the Crown; second, 
on a Statute Merchant or Statute-Staple, or Recognizance in the Nature of a Statute-Staple; and third, on a

Judgment in an Action of Debt against an heir, on the obligation of his ancestor.’ ~ 


Page 619 of 735 


The debts owed to the King are either of Record, or Not of Record, but in both cases the Execution for them is a 
Writ of Extent, which is either an immediate extent, or one in aid of the King’s Debtor. As to debts Not of Record, 
the Remedy for recovery of them was governed by the Statute of 33 Her,. VIII, c. 39, 5 Statutes at Large 115 (1541), 
which provided that all obligations and specialties made for any cause touching the King or his heirs, were to be of 
the same effect as writings obligatory acknowledged according to the Statute of the Staple at Westminster. 


The Execution of this Writ was directed against the body, lands and goods of the Crown debtor. And the Sheriff 
was commanded to inquire by a Jury what goods and lands the defendant was seized of, to appraise and extend 
them, and to take and seize the same into the King’s hands. 


In the court of Exchequer, under a practice recognized and controlled by Statutes, a debtor of the Crown might 
invoke in his behalf, the Writ of Extendi Facias, for the purpose of collecting a debt of equal amount due him 
from any subject, the theory being that without the aid of such Writ the Crown might be unable to collect its claim 


against its debtor. Such a Writ could also be invoked by a surety of a debtor to the Crown Who had paid the debt of 
the Crown Debtor. As so used the writ was called a Writ of Extendi Facias in Aid, as opposed to a Writ of Extendi 
Facias in Chief, where it was employed only to collect debts directly due to the Crown. 


The Writ of Capias Ad Satisfacienduin 

The ordinary Common-Law Method of enforcing a Judgment where money only is recovered, as damages or a 

debt and not any specific chattel, is now, as it anciently was, 
15. Id. at 043.

THE EXECUTION

by seizure and sale of the property of the defendant. Execution against the person was, however, at an early date 
extended from criminal procedure, so that the body of the debtor was or might be imprisoned until satisfaction was 
made for the debt, costs or damages. 

This species of Execution was by a Writ of Capias Ad Satisfaciendum, and was assumed by the Courts to be 
availaNe wherever the defendant was liable to be taken upon a writ of Capias Ad Res’pondendum, to compel ap- 
pearance at the beginning of the suit, or as a provisional remedy and security for the Judgment. At first this Writ was 
available to subject to imprisonment the body of the defendant in Trespass Vi Et .~4rrnis only." It was then 
extended to the Actions of Debt and Detinue by the Statute of 25 Edw. Ill, c. 17, 2 Statutes at Large 59 (1350), and 
to the Action on the Case in 1503.” The original exemption from arrest at Common Law was probably due to feudal 
reasons, rather than to a regard for personal liberty. 


Where a defendant is at large when the Writ issues, it commands the Sheriff to take body of the defendant, to 
keep him safely, so that he may have his body in Court on the return-day to satisfy the plaintiff of the debt or 
damages recovered. When the defendant was already in custody, there was no occasion for the Writ. The effect of this 


Writ, taken after Judgment, was to deprive the defendant of his liberty until he made satisfaction Of the debt or 
damages.'* If he

did not make satisfaction, he had to remain in custody, at his own expense or the charity of others.th 


And the fact that the Writ, among other things, took a man’s liberty, led to great hardship and injustice, as is well 
portrayed in the writings of Dickens.” In the Eighteenth Century, by Rules of the King’s Bench Prison, by Rules of 
court, and by Statute, steps were taken to reduce the hardships of poor debtors confined in prison on Civil Process. 


Thus, if a prisoner tendered sufficient security, he was permitted his freedom within certain limits outside the jail

defendant charged in Execution for a debt not exceeding 1100, which was later extended to £300 by 33 Geo. UI, c. 
5, 39 Statutes at Large 24 (1793) ,22 surrendered his assets to his creditors, except wearing apparel, bedding and tools 
of trade, not in excess of £10, and made oath to comply with the Statute, he might be discharged, unless the creditor 
otherwise insisted, in which case he was compelled to pay the prisoner a certain amount per week, Thereafter, in 
England, imprisonment for debt was abolished, except in the case of fraudulent debtors, by the Debtors Act, 32 & 33 
Vict. c. 62, 109 Statutes at Large 201 (1869), and its amendments.

Ch. 29 
THE LIEN OF EXECUTIONS 


318. A General Lien of an Execution binds property after the Writ has come into the hands of the Sheriff and 
while the Writ remains unsatisfied. 


Where goods taken in Execution were permitted to remain in the custody of the debtor, ar Common Law such goods might be 
seized at the suit of another creditor. 


At Common Law and in England, the Writ of Fieri Facias bound the defendant’s goods from the time of its teste, 
so that a sale of the goods made thereafter by the defendant, though bona fide, might have been avoided.” This was 
changed by Section 16 of the Statute of Frauds,”-' under which the Writ was to bind the property from the time such 
Writ was delivered to the Sheriff to be executed, who was to endorse on the back thereof when he received the same. 
But even so, the property in the goods is not altered until the Writ is actually executed. 


If the party dies after the teste, but before the delivery of the Writ to the Sheriff, the goods are bound in the hands 
of his executors or administrators. As to this situation, the Law is as it was before the Statute, as this involved no 
change of property by sale and for a valuable consideration. 


And under the Statute of Frauds,” it has been held that a party who bought goods at a sale under an Execution, 
which had been delivered to the Sheriff subsequent to the delivery of a prior Execution, was protected from the prior 
Execution, although, as to any other party, the goods were bound by the prior 


23- This common-Law Rule prevailed in Tennessee: 
coffee v. Wray, S Yerg. (Penn.) 464 (1835); cecil v. carson, 80 Tenn. 139, 5 S.W. 532 (1887); in North carolina: Palmer v. clarke, is Itc.(2

delivery of the first Writ, under which the Sheriff ought to have taken and sold thent'"® 


In Rogers V. Dickey,” an fllinois Court, in commenting on the priority of Execution, declared: “First, that where 


two or more Writs of Fieri Facias are delivered at different times, either to the same or different officers, and no 
sale is actually made of the defendant’s goods, the Execution first delivered must have the priority, though the first 
seizure may have been made on a subsequent Execution. Second, but where the goods are actually sold by virtue of a 


Page 621 of 735 


levy made under a Junior Execution, the sale will be good, and the property can not afterwards be taken from the 
purchaser by the Senior Execution. The only remedy of the party injured is against the officer.” 


Where goods were taken in Execution and suffered to remain in the custody of the debtor, at Common Law, such 
goods might be seized at the suit of another creditor.” 


Finally, a General Lien of an Execution binds property acquired after the Writ has come into the hands of the 
Sheriff and while the Writ remains unsatisfied.*°

be bad to personalty, the general rule now is that the Judgment creates a lien on Real Property. 


Certain of the Common Law Writs continue in use, especially that of Fieri Facias, although they may be designated by other names. 


AS among the Common Law Writs, Fiert Facias still flourishes, “frequently, it is true, in a code disguise.” 31 
The Writ of Elegit was too feeble a Remedy to survive, although it was long used in Virginia.”

One of the surviving Common-Law Writs of Execution, the Writ of Fjeri Facias, is employed in some States 
under its original name, whereas in others it is used under the Code designation of a Writ of Execution. The early 
Common-Law Rule exempting lands from sale on Executions has been abolished by Statutes, and while under such 
Statutes resort must usually first be had to personalty, the general rule now is that the Judgment creates a lien on the

judicial in its nature and affecting either a public or private right. Thus for example, it may be used to prevent a Judge or

low, in Cases where the Proceedings are Not According to the Course of the Common Law, and there is no other 
Method of Review. 


THE established method by which the Court of King’s Bench from the earliest times exercised superintendence over 
the due observance of their limitations by Inferior Courts, checked the usurpation of Jurisdiction, and maintained the 
Supremacy of the Royal Courts, was by the Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition, A Writ of Certiorari (cause to be 
certified) is a Special Proceeding by which a Superior Court Orders some Inferior Tribunal, Board, or Judicial 
Officer to trails-mit the Record of its Proceedings for Review, for Excess of Jurisdiction. It is similar to a Writ of 
Error, in that it is a Proceeding -in a Higher Court to Supervise and Review Judicial Acts, but it was available only 
in cases Not Reviewable by Writ of Error or otherwise. It does not Review Proceedings within the Jurisdiction of the 
Lower Court, but inquires into the Jurisdiction and Regularity of the Proceedings. Ordinarily, the Writ did not lie 
after Judgment. But in some instances, as in certain cases of summary proceedings before an Inferior Court, where 
the proceedings were not according to the Course of Common Law,” and there was no other method of review, 
Certiorari was permitted even after Final Judgment.” But Errors in rulings which occurred at the Trial could only be 
reviewed by Motion for New Trial, Bill of Exceptions, or under Modern Procedure, by Appeal. Certiorari does not 
lie to Review Executive, Ministerial, or Legislative action of other Departments of Government, but merely corrects 
encroachments of Jurisdiction, where some Judicial Officer has exceeded his authority, and there is no other remedy 
for Review by Writ of Error or Appeal.’

THE WRIT OF ERROR"? 


322. At Common Law a Writ of Error was 


-an Original Writ, issuing out of Chancery, at the instance of a Party aggrieved by any Error in the Foundation, Proceeding, Judgment 


-or Execution of a Suit, in a Court of Record; and was in the Nature of a Commission to the Judges of the same or a Superior Court, by which 
they were authorized to examine the Rec 
-end, upon which Judgment was given, and on such examination to Affirm or Reverse the same. 


The Writ of Error: in General 
AT Common Law, a Substantive Defect Apparent Upon the Face of the Record, was 
-available at the Pleading Stage, on Demurrer; After Verdict and Before Judgment, by Motion in Arrest of 
Judgment; and After Final Judgment, by Writ of Error, which, if 
-obtained and allowed before Execution, op 
-erated as a suspension of the Latter Proceeding till the Former was determined.

was in the Nature of a Commission to the Judges of the Same or a Superior Court, by which they were authori~ed to 
examine the Record upon which Judgment was given. In other words the Writ of Error was an Order, directed to the 
Judges of the Court in which the Judgment had been given, commanding them, in some cases themselves, to review 
the Record; in others, to send it to another Court of Appellate Jurisdiction to be examined in order that some alleged 
Error in the Proceedings might be corrected. The first Form of Writ was called a Writ of Error Corarn Nobis, or 
Corain Vobis, and was designed to reach the situation where the Error consists of Matter of Fact; the second, called 
a Writ of Error generally, was directed at an Error in Law Apparent Upon the Face of the Common-Law Record. 
The Writ was grantable cx debito justitiae {from or as a debt of justice, or as a matter of right] in all cases except 
Treasons and Felony.” 


The strict Common-Law Record consisted of four parts: (1) The Process, which included the Original Writ and 
the Return of the Sheriff; (2) The Declaration and All Subsequent Pleadings, including Demurrers, if any; (3) The 
Verdict, and (4) The Judgment. After the Judgment has been entered on the Record, by removing this Record to the 
Appellate Court and Assigning Errors upon it, the unsuccessful Party in the Trial Court could secure a Review of 
any Error of Law Apparent upon the Face of Any Portion of the Common-Law Record, the objective being to 


Page 626 of 735 


reverse or modify the Judgment for some Error of Law supposed to exist in the Proceedings as recorded. And in 
Ruling on such Writ, Errors Not Apparent on the Common-Law Record constituted no ground of Error. If the 
alleged Error was Not One Apparent upon the Face of the Record, but consisted of an Error that occurred at the 


Trial, such as the Improper Admission or Re-

jection of Evidence, Prejudicial Remarks on the Part of Counsel in the Opening and Cosing Arguments, 
Misdirection of the Jury, and the like, there was, prior to 1285, No Method of Review, except by Motion for New 
Trial, which Motion was made After Verdict and Before Judgment, before the Court En Bane, sitting at Westminster, 
of which Court the Trial. Judge was usually a member. This Court could grant or refuse a New Trial as a matter of 
discretion, the exercise of which was not Reviewable at Common Law. 


The Writ of Error is usually brought by the Party or Parties against whom the Judgment was given; but it may be 
brought by a plaintiff to Reverse his own Judgment, if erroneous, in order to enable him to bring another action.”! 
But the defendant was not permitted to bring it contrary to his own agreement or that of his Attorney.” 


In general, a Writ of Error was available for any Error or Defect in Substance that had not been Aided, Amended 
or Cured at Common Law, or by the effect of one or more of the Statutes of Amendments and Jeofails.”* Thus, the 
Entry of a Judgment in a Form inappropriate to the Specific Form of Action, constituted an Error of Law. And if the 
plaintiff brings an Action of Ejectment and omits the Allegation of Ouster, alleging only Title and Damages, such 
omission of a Substantive Allegation will be available on Writ of Error after Final Judgment. 


And in this connection, it should be observed that there was some doubt as to whether a Judgment on Demurrer 
could be Reviewed as a part of the Common-Law Record, without taking an Exception. Speaking to this very point 
in Hamlin v. Reynolds 2 


21. Johnson v. Jebb, 3 Burr 1772, 97 Eng.Rep. 1091 (1705). 
22. Cates + West, 2 T.R. 183, 100 Eng.Rep. 90 (1787).

Walker, 3., declared: “It is believed that no reported case can be found, either in Great Britain or this country, in 
which it has been held that it is necessary to Except to the Judgment on a Demurrer, to enable the Party to have the 
decision Reviewed in an Appellate Court. By the Ancient Practice it was the Final Judgment in the case, on the 
Count or Plea to which the Demurrer was interposed, and Leave to Amend or Plead Over was rarely if ever given. 
And the Judgment on Demurrer, by the Modern Practice, is Final, unless the Court in the exercise of its discretion 
permits an Amendment, or grants Leave to Plead Over. The Judgment on the Demurrer is as much a Part of the 
Record as any other Judgment that is rendered by the Court in the Cause. The Office of a Bill of Exceptions is to 
preserve that of Record, which otherwise would not Appear of Record. By the Practice of Courts of Common-Law 
Jurisdiction, the Evidence in a Cause, the Decisions of the Court in Admitting or Rejecting Evidence, Affidavits on 
Motions, and the Reasons Upon which Motions are Made, the Giving and Refusing Instructions, and Various Other 


Matters, do not Appear of Record, and are no part of it, unless embodied in a Bill of Exceptions, and by that means are 
made a part of the Record in the case. In the-decision of all such questions, the Judgment of the Court is not usually 
spread upon the Roll of its Proceedings. While Judgments by Default, on Demurrer, in cases of Nonsuit, Final 
Judgment on Verdict, etc., have by the practice at all periods, been so Entered and regarded as a Part of the Record. It 
would be improper practice, to embody a Judgment on a Demurrer in a Bill of Exceptions, as it would uselessly 
incumber the Record and unnecessarily add to the expense of litigation. The position that the Judgment on the 
Demurrer to the Second and Third Pleas in this case, was not Excepted to in the Court Below is-wholly untenable,”

The Writ of Error: Coram Nobis 


Page 627 of 735 


WHERE a Judgment was Erroneous in Point of Fact only, and Not in Point of Law, it could be reversed by the 
same Court, by Writ of Error Coram Nobis, or Quac Corant Nobis Resident, so called from its being founded on the 
Record and Process, which were 
-stated in the Writ to remain in the Court of the Lord the King, before the King himself; as where the defendant, 
being under age, appeared by Attorney, or the plaintiff or defendant was a married woman, at the Commencement of 
the Suit, or died before Verdict, or Interlocutory Judgment; for Error in Fact was not the Error of the Judges, hence 
reversing it was not reversing their own Judgment. 


BILLS OF EXCEPTIONS” 


323. A Bill of Exceptions is a Statement of Objections or Exceptions taken by a Party to the Rulings of the Court 
on Points of Law, Signed by the Judge who made the Decision, and Sealed with the Seal of the Court. - 


AS observed in the discusElon of the Writ 
-of Error, Errors Apparent Upon the Face of the Common-Law Record, after Final Judgment, were Reviewable by 
Writ of Error. If the alleged Error was One Not Apparent Upon the Face of the Record, but consisted of an Error that 
occurred At the Trial, such

as the Improper Admission or Rejection of Evidence, Misdirection ofthe Jury, or Prejudicial Remarks on the Part of 
Counsel in Opening and Closing Arguments, and the like, prior to 1285, there was No Method of Review except by 
Motion for New Trial, which Motion, as we have seen, was made before the Court En Banc sitting at Westminster, 
of which Court the Trial Judge was frequently a member. This Court could grant or refuse to grant a New Trial in its 
discretion, the exercise of which at Common Law was not Reviewable. This Method of Review left the Aggrieved 
Party somewhat at the mercy of the Original Trial Judge, as he was usually a Part of the Reviewing Court En Banc, 
and it provided No Method for Review, after Judgment, of Errors which occurred At the Trial. Obviously, a New 
Method was needed by which such Errors could be incorporated into the Record. 


The Origin of the Bifl of Exceptions 

THE Method devised had its origin in that Great Remedial Statute of the Common Law, the Statute of 
Westminster II, 13 Edw. I, c. 31, 1 Statutes at Large 206 (1285), under which it was provided, in Substance, that 
where an Error occurred At the Trial, such as the Improper Admission of Evidence, the Aggrieved Party could 
allege an Exception; if the Exception was not allowed, he could reduce the Exception to Writing,” have it Signed 
and Sealed by the Judge, and Attach it to the Record. This operation incorporated the alleged Errors into the Record 
and when the Writ of Error issued, not only those Errors Apparent Upon the Face of the Common-Law Record, if 
any, but also those Errors which occurred At the Trial, and which had now been incorporated by means 


26.The time for reducing the exception to writing was not prescribed by the statute, but it was held in the case of Wright -r. Sharp, 1 Salk. 288, 
250, 91 Eng. Rep. 255, 258 (1705), that reason required the substance of the exception be reduced to writing when taken and disallowed.

of the force and effect of Chapter 31 of the Statute of Westminster U, also went up to the Appellate Court for 
Review. And thus the explanation of the distinction between Matters on the Record, and Matters in the Record, or, 
as sometimes otherwise expressed, between Matter of Record and Matter of Exception, Matter of Record consisting 
of Errors Apparent Upon the Face of the Strict Common-Law Record; Matter of Exception referring to those Errors 
placed in the Record by the Bill of Exceptions. 


STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RIfLES 


Page 628 of 735 


OF COURT 


324. Review is now generally by Appeal, which is a Statutory Proceeding. Where the Action is Legal in Nature, the 
Appeal is generally limited to a Review of Questions of Law. 


Where the Action is Equitable in Nature, Questions of both Law and Fact are Reviewed on 
Appeal, as was traditionally the case in Equity. 


In 1848 the New York Code of Civil Procedure made an Appeal the only Form of Review in that State. Other 
States abolished the Writ of Error, but created a System of Review which included a Review of Legal Causes by 
Proceedings in Error, and for Equitable Causes Review on the lines of the Appeal in Chancery.” An Appeal in New 
York was at that time regarded as a New Action.”° In those States which did not adopt the New York Statutory 
Appeal, an Appeal in the Nature of a Writ of Error was adopted, including Alabama in 1853, Connecticut in 1882 
and 1889, and Pennsylvania in 1889.20 The Method of Appeal in New York, being entirely Statutory, it was 
available only in the situations specifically provided for by the

Code. In States where there was a Concurrence of Review by @ Writ of Error and an Appeal in the Nature of Error, 

the term “Appeal” began to be regarded as covering both Types of Review. This gradual merger of the two principal 

Modes of Review was a byproduct flowing from the introduction of Equitable Defenses and Equitable Relief in Ac- 

tions at Law. - 


In the States today, Review on Appeal is generally a Statutory Proceeding, with more of the characteristics of the 
Common-Law Writ of Error, rather than the Appeal in Equity, by which the whole cause was removed from a lower 
to an Appellate Court, and 


there tried tie novo Without reference to the 
conclusions of the Inferior Court. The Modern Appeal is more in the nature of a Writ of Error, in that the Appellate 
Court does not try the cause afresh or hear evidence. It is regarded as a continuation of the Original Litigation. 


In an attempt to modernize and simplify Appellate Review in the Federal Courts, even before the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure were adopted, Congress, in 1928, abolished the Writ of Error in all cases, Civil and Criminal, 
except in cases coming from State Courts, and substituted the Modern Appeal as the Vehicle for Ordinary Appellate 
Review.” The effect of this Legislation was to make Uniform the Procedure for Review in both Law and Equity, 
since prior to 1928 the Appeal, and not the Writ of Error, was the Method of Review from a Decree in Equity.” 


However, this Legislation did not remove the differences that had theretofore existed

Act of April 26, 1928, c. 440. The wisdom of this

with respect to the Scope of Review for Actions at Law and in Equity. Perhaps the most significant difference was 
that Appeals from Judgments of Law Courts continued to be limited to Review of Questions of Law only, whereas 
an Appeal from an Equitable Decree permitted Review of the Facts as well as the Law.” 


Today, the basic Federal Judicial Structure is composed of District Courts, Courts of Appeals -<and the Supreme 
Court.” The District Courts “are the Trial Courts of the System” and exist in each of the numerous Judicial Districts

able as of Right to the Court of Appeals, “except where a Direct Review may be had in the Supreme Court.” ~ The 
distinction between Appeals in Actions which are Legal in Nature, and those which are Equitable in Nature, is 
maintained, with the Appellate Court reviewing Questions of Law as to the Former and both Law and Fact as to the 
Latter,” except that the Appellate Court also reviews Questions of both Law and Fact in Actions which are Legal in 
Nature when the Action is tried by a Court without a Jury.” In Actions which are Equitable in Nature, and those 
which are Legal in Nature and tried by a Court without a Jury, the Findings of Fact of the Trial Court may, however, 
be set aside by the Appellate Court only when they are dearly erroneous, and provided due regard is given to the 
opportunity of the Trial Court to judge the credibility of witnesses.*°
